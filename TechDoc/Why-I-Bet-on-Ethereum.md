Back when the wild west of cryptocurrencies was first in full swing and the mainstream media was swamped with stories of drug cartels and launderers smuggling millions through bitcoin, it was pretty hard for an average person to see the value in the concept of a virtual currency. Among the initial questions that echoed across the world were

回到“加密货币”的狂野西部第一次全面爆发的时候，主流媒体充斥着贩毒集团和洗钱者通过比特币来走私数百万美元的的故事，一般人很难看到虚拟货币的价值。在世界各地的最初的问题中：

“What are the practical applications of this aside from buying drugs on silk road?”

“除了在丝绸之路上买药，还有什么实际的应用?”


“How secure is it, really?”
”它有多安全?“

Fast forward a few years and although we have come a long way and blockchain education is easier to access, there is still a strain of naysayers with arguments that focus solely on the currency and not as much on the powerful, but subtle implications of decentralized systems.


经过快速推进的这几年，尽管我们已经走了很长一段路，而且区块链的教育更容易获得，但仍有一群反对者的反驳说道，他们只关注于货币，而不是去中心化系统的强大而微妙的影响。

These questions are a result of a lack of education on the technology underlying cryptocurrencies themselves, namely, the blockchain. There was too much of a focus on trying to frame Bitcoin purely in transactional terms, automatically assuming the same of other blockchain protocols and completely missing the point.

这些问题是由于加密货币本身——即区块链——所缺乏的技术教育所造成的。人们过于关注只以交易的方式来框定比特币，并且自动地假设其他区块链协议与之一样，完全忽略了其技术性。

### A Turing Complete System
### 一个完全图灵系统

With distributed ledgers came the advent of those desiring more expressive capabilities and applications on these systems. It was only a matter of time before developers were asking why not create fully decentralized applications that do more than just handle payments? Companies started to use blockchain systems as a way to store certain types of data, with various projects aiming to use a blockchain as an immutable store of knowledge, even though large portion of the Bitcoin community have been opposed to on-chain data storage. Many started to ask, could we go even further or use the blockchain for computational purposes?


随着分布式账本的出现，那些希望在这些系统上呈现更多表达能力和应用程序的人出现了。不久后开发者们就问，为什么不创建完全去中心化的应用程序，而不仅仅只是处理支付问题。公司开始使用区块链系统作为存储特定类型数据的一种方式，各种各样的项目旨在使用区块链作为一种不可变的知识存储库，尽管比特币社区的很大一部分人一直反对链锁数据存储。许多人开始问，我们能不能更进一步，或者使用区块链进行计算?


The Ethereum project gave us exactly that: a Turing complete environment where anyone can code up smart contracts and spin up entire token ecosystems and applications on a public blockchain. This “global computer” brought us promises that we could only dream of when simplified versions of this idea were conceived by other projects such as MasterCoin. Bitcoin has rejected this level of abstraction and logic within its core system, deliberately using Script, a language with limited expressive capabilities to prevent malicious users from hijacking the blockchain programatically. However, Ethereum has embraced its Turing completeness as its most noteworthy & notorious feature. Although we are able to build any sort of application by leveraging the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), this expressiveness undoubtedly comes at an enormous cost…

以太坊项目给了我们这样的结果:完全图灵的环境，任何人都可以在公共区块链上编码智能契约，并将整个代币生态系统和应用程序进行自旋。这个“全球计算机”带给我们的承诺是，我们只需要想象这个想法的简化版本被其他的项目，比如主币，所构思的时刻比特币在其核心系统中拒绝了这种抽象和逻辑，故意使用一种表达能力有限的脚本语言，来防止恶意用户以区块链的方式劫持区块链。然而，Ethereum已经将其“图灵”的完整性作为其最值得关注和臭名昭著的特征。尽管我们可以通过使用Ethereum虚拟机(EVM)来构建任何类型的应用程序，但是这种表达无疑付出了巨大的代价。

### Safety-Critical Systems & Big Hacks
### 安全关键系统和大型黑客侵入


Unfortunately, smart contracts have to be written by humans and are prone to extremely critical bugs such as the parity hack where an internal method had public access and was able to be called by anyone, allowing hackers to steal over $30M USD worth of Ether. Teams are even employing formal mathematicians to prove the security of their smart contracts, but is this even enough to prevent small issues that can cost millions to the entire community?

不幸的是，智能合同必须由人类编写，而且容易出现极其严重的漏洞，比如奇奇黑客，内部方法有公共访问权限，任何人都可以调用，允许黑客窃取价值超过3000万美元的乙醚。团队甚至雇佣正式的数学家来证明他们的智能契约的安全性，但这是否足以让整个社区耗费数百万美元来防止小问题?


So then, is Turing completeness a good idea for blockchains? Maybe not at a large scale for now, but in my opinion, it is the best proving ground we could ask for to accelerate this ecosystem even faster.

那么，对于区块链来说，图灵的完整性是一个好主意吗?也许现在还没有大规模的发展，但在我看来，这是我们可以要求的最好的证明，让这个生态系统更快地加速。

### Ethereum Gives Back Power to Developers
### 以太坊向开发者提供了支持

Despite the obvious flaws of Solidity as a smart contract language, and oh boy are there so many, the Ethereum community did one small thing very, very well: giving agency and tools to developers that had been aching to get their feet wet in crypto.

尽管作为一种智能的合同语言存在明显的缺陷，而且缺失却有那么多，以太社区做了一件非常非常好的事情:给开发人员提供代理和工具，他们一直渴望在加密货币中布局。

Coming from a background in Javascript web development and data science, it was already hard enough to keep up with the newest JS framework and best practice that seemed to pop up every week. As annoying as Javascript fatigue was, the ecosystem managed to flourish because of the vibrant experimentation all types of devs did. Junior & senior developers worked tirelessly on testing front-end tools such as React, Redux, and the babel transpiler to the max to figure out what the best way to build web apps was. As flawed as javascript is as a language, the community was always able to find a way and the tooling got better and better.

从Javascript web开发和数据科学的背景中，我们已经很难跟上最新的JS框架和最佳实践了，这似乎是每周都会出现的状况。与Javascript疲倦一样令人讨厌的是，由于各种类型的开发人员所做的充满活力的实验，这个生态系统得以蓬勃发展。初级和高级开发人员不知疲倦地在测试前端工具，如反应、回传和babel传译器，以找出构建web应用的最佳方式是什么。作为一种语言，javascript有缺陷，社区总是能够找到一种方法，工具也变得越来越好。

We went from not having best practices for managing state in a web application to having extremely robust libraries such as Redux as solutions major problem within a short span of time. Sure, many JS developers accepted parts of their community as broken, but that only gave them an excuse to work even harder and innovate for the good of everyone.

我们从没有在web应用程序中实现状态的最佳实践，到在短时间内将Redux等极其健壮的库作为解决方案的主要问题。当然，许多JS开发人员认为他们社区的某些部分是被破坏的，但这只是给了他们一个借口，让他们更加努力地工作，为每个人的利益而创新。
