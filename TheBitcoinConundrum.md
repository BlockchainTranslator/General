*Cryptocurrencies have entered a confusing time. Only last year, the digital coins became the hype that dominated the internet. Now the market is experiencing problems, and the value of crypto has become unsure. In spite of, or maybe because of this volatility, virtual currencies managed to attract the attention of central banks and monetary funds all around the world. One of those interested in crypto is the Dutch central bank. The financial institute recently published a study on the use of Bitcoin as a payment method for online stores. Will Bitcoin become the next shopping currency?*

*加密货币进入了一段令人困惑的时间。仅过去一年，数字货币在互联网就被大肆宣传。现在，这个市场正在经历一些问题，而且加密货币的价值变得不那么确定。尽管存在这种波动性，或者可能因为这种波动性，虚拟货币吸引到了各国央行和全世界的货币基金的注意。荷兰央行最近发布了一份关于用比特币作为在线支付方式的研究。比特币会成为下一个支付货币吗？*

In its study, the Dutch central bank focused on the penetration of Bitcoin as payment method among Dutch online retailers. They asked the online store owners about their use of the cryptocurrency and their reasons for doing so or holding off. Those who accepted Bitcoin mostly did so because they think it attracts new customers (42%), as a response to their customers’ demands (23% ) or because of their interest in the technology (21%). The nay-sayers cited unfamiliarity with the coin (58%), a lack of consumer demand (36%) and the perceived lack of trust (16%) as their primary reasons for not accepting Bitcoin yet. Those not accepting the coin weren’t steadfast on their position: 26 percent said that they would be willing to take cryptocurrency as payment in their online store if the consumer wants it.

在这份研究中，荷兰央行重点关注比特币在荷兰在线零售商中作为支付方式的使用情况。他们询问店主关于加密货币的使用情况以及使用比特币和不使用的原因。那些接受比特币支付的人大多是因为这几种情况：能吸引新的客人（占 42%），顾客自身的需求（占 23%），对这一技术感兴趣（占 21%）。那些不采用比特币支付的人则是因为：不了解它（占 58%），客人需求不大（占 36%），不信任它（占 16%）。那些不接收比特币的人对他们的观点并不是坚定不移：26% 的人说，如果客人想用的话，他们愿意接受加密货币作为支付方式。

And that last bit, the consumer demand, is where the issue lies for Bitcoin as a payment method. It seems that we are dealing with a chicken and egg scenario when it comes to the digital coin. The online retailer has little problem accepting the currency if the consumer wants to pay with it, but the average consumer has no interest in buying a coin that cannot be used as payment. There are, of course, exceptions in those people who buy Bitcoin and hold it as an investment. But for most consumers, the digital coin is something that doesn’t concern them, and that they have no use for at this time.

最后那句－客人需要的话－是比特币作为支付方式的问题所在。这一情况好像是，在说到数字货币时，我们面临的情形是先有鸡还是先有蛋。如果客人想要用比特币支付的话，在线零售商接受它是没有什么问题的，但一般的消费者没有什么兴趣去购买这个不能用作支付方式的比特币。当然，那些人当中也有一些例外，他们购买比特币，当作投资来持有它。但是，对大多数消费者来说，数字货币不是他们关心的东西，而且他们当下也用不着它。

This puts the cryptocurrency in a bit of an impasse. If it wants to become the next payment method, it seems that something needs to change. These measures could help Bitcoin on its way to becoming an asset used in exchange for products:

这使加密货币陷于僵局当中。如果比特币要成为下一个支付方式，似乎得要改变点什么。这些方法可能有助于比特币成为一种可用来购买商品的资产。

**Increased customer knowledge**
**提升顾客认识**

Even though the coin has had plenty of publicity, the overall knowledge of it is still low. A study done among Americans showed that 79 percent had heard about Bitcoin, but half of those people were unsure about its legality. The company behind the survey, LendEDU, says that Bitcoin still has a long way to go before it moves onto the mass market. The education of people about Bitcoin and its workings can help move this process along. A better understanding of the coin can make it more attractive to the average consumer, and help push its acceptation by the bigger crowd.

即使比特币已经被人熟知，但是对它的整体认识还是比较低。对美国人进行的研究显示，79% 的人听说过比特币，但是有一半的人并不确信它的合法性。进行这一调查的公司 LendEDU 说，在比特币进入大众市场之前，它仍旧有相当的长路要走。对人们进行比特币及其工作方式的教育能够推进这一过程。更好的理解比特币能够增加普通消费者的兴趣，有助于提升它被更大的人群所接受。

**Acceptance by shopping systems**
**购物系统的认可**

We should give credit where credit is due: some big players in the eCommerce industry already accept Bitcoin. Shopping solution Shopify and payment method Mollie have both integrated the digital coin into their service. Then there are eCommerce solutions that do not support Bitcoin themselves but have an unaffiliated plugin that can be used, such as WooCommerce and Magento.

我们应当给予肯定这一行为：电子商务领域一些大型零售商已经接受比特币。购物系统 Shopify 和支付服务提供商 Mollie 都将数字货币整合到他们的系统中。有一些电子商务的解决方法自身不支持比特币，但有第三方插件可以使用，比如 WooCommerce 和 Magento。

When we look at the most used payment providers and shopping cart systems, however, there is still room for improvement. Of the 15 most popular payment providers, only four support Bitcoin at this moment. With shopping cart systems this number is considerably higher, 11 out of 15 accept crypto, but 8 of them only do so via a plugin that isn’t theirs. 

可是，当我们察看那些被广泛使用的支付服务提供商和购物系统时，仍旧有改进的空间。15 家最为人们接受的支付服务提供商，只有 4 家支持比特币。对于购物系统，15 家中有 11 家接受加密货币，这个数字相当高了，但是其中 8 家只是通过第三方插件来实现的。

If Bitcoin wants to become a payment method, these numbers aren’t enough. For consumers to get the feeling that the crypto is an accepted way of paying, the large shopping systems and payment providers need to make their support of the crypto clear.

如果比特币想成为支付方式，这些数字还不够。为了消费者感受到加密货币是一种可被接受的支付方式，大型购物系统和支付服务提供商需要非常明确地表示出他们对比特币的支持。

**Bitcoin's fluctuating price**
**比特币价格的波动**

It can be ten thousand dollars for a Bitcoin on Monday, and seven thousand for that same coin a day later. These staggering changes in its value make Bitcoin an unreliable payment method. You don’t want to spend a hundred dollars’ worth of Bitcoin on a new jacket, find out a day later that you have only paid eighty bucks because of the price volatility and then be asked to fork over that last twenty dollars to make up for the difference. Before the coin can become a payment method, it will need to stabilize.

一枚比特币周一可能是 10000 美元，一天后可能变成 7000 美元。比特币价格上的不稳定使得它成为一种不太可靠的支付方式。你不想花价值 100 块钱的比特币买条裤子，一天后发现，由于价格的波动你只付了 80 块，然后被要求再付上 20 块钱来补上差价。在比特币能成为支付方式前，它需要能够变得稳定。

**Energy consuming transactions**
**交易消耗能量**

It dominated the news last year: the process that transfers Bitcoin payments is a difficult one. The coin uses a great deal of power to process payments and on top of that, the payments can take a long time to go through. You can pay extra to make sure that the system handles your transfer first, but this makes the transaction fee so high that it is often not worth the cost. Before we can start to use Bitcoin as a worldwide payment method, these issues have to be solved. A solution in the form of the lightning network seems on its way, but we will have to wait and see.

去年，众多媒体都报道了这条新闻：比特币支付的过程是个令人头疼的问题。比特币使用算力来处理支付，而且，重要的是，这些支付需要很长的时间来完成。你可以多付一点钱来确保这个系统先处理你的交易，但是这使得整个交易费太高，对成本来说不值得。在比特币成为世界通用的支付方式前，这些问题都得要被解决掉。闪电网络这一解决方案似乎可行，我们将拭目以待。

Even if all these changes are implemented, and consumers become more Bitcoin-savvy, the question of whether Bitcoin will become the next big payment method remains. According to the study by the Dutch central bank: ‘It seems unlikely that crypto acceptance by online retailers will rise substantially in the near future’. We, unfortunately, do not have a crystal ball to predict what will happen to the digital coin. What do you think, will the future of Bitcoin be as a payment method?

即使这些问题都被解决，消费者对比特币也有了更深的认识，比特币是否会成为下一个支付方式仍旧是个问题。荷兰央行这一研究指出：“在线零售商对加密货币的接受程度在不远的将来似乎不太可能会有显著的增长。”不幸的是，我们并没有预测比特币未来的水晶球。你认为，比特币未来会成为支付方式吗？

Chuan：比特币的支付确认时间过长让人诟病，这会很大程度上影响其在小额支付方面被应用的程度。闪电网络有可能成为奠定比特币作为功能货币的技术：即时支付、每秒可处理交易数以及低廉的手续费。
