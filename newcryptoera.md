Since the advent of the “ICO” there has been a surge in new blockchain projects coming forth with a coinsale. Further, since Bitcoin and many Alts hit their all time high (ATH) in December 2017, the price of most exchange traded coins has tailed off.

自从ICO问世以来，新的区块链项目暴增，这些项目都带有代币销售。此外，自从比特币和许多山寨币的价格在2017年12月都创了新高后，大多数交易所交易的代币价格慢慢回落。

For this reason the long term view of bitcoin/alt Hodlers is now under question as the price appreciation which propelled so many fortunes during the 2017 price pump, has now subsided in favour of a market caught in trading ranges.

因此，随着推动2017年财富暴涨的价格上涨已经回落，来支持一个价格有涨有降的市场，那些长期持有比特币或山寨币的人在遭受质疑。

Many hodlers have grown impatient or weary of the daily decline in their Net Asset Valuation (NAV) so are looking for other ways to supplement their crypto portfolio value. This is where the ICO market is looking increasingly attractive as returns of multiple times.

许多持有者变得不耐心或者担心他们的净资产每天的减少，所以开始寻找其他的方式来增加他们的加密货币投资组合的价值。这就是ICO市场由于带来很多倍的回报而日益产生吸引力的原因。

The largest ICO’s such as telegram, Filecoin, Bancor or Bankera all having raised over $100m in their coinsale have presented early investors with an incredible opportunity to multiply their investment within a short time. Presale discounts and incentives such as bonus tokens or bounties give maximum reward to the earliest believers in the project .

那些规模非常大的ICO，如telegram, Filecoin, Bancor 或者 Bankera 都通过代币销售募集到了1亿多美元，给早期的投资者在非常短的时间内实现投资翻番的机会。预售价格的打折和激励手段如奖励代币或红包给那些支持项目的早期参与者带来了最大程度的回报。

A major example of early investors who have hit it big would be Mike Novogratz who invested $500k in Ethereum at an early stage and is now sitting on $250m of ETH from that same investment. Now a 500x ROI is rare even in ICO terms, but the opportunities are still coming up even in a market that is seeing more and more ICO’s by the day.

一个早期投资者获得巨大回报的例子可能就是Mike Novogratz，他在以太坊项目的早期投入了50万，现在拥有价值2亿5千万的ETH。现在，一个500倍的投资回报率在ICO中很少见了，但是，当出现越来越多的ICO，这样的机会仍旧在发生。

Now the main activity of many ICO investors is DD (due diligence) which is effectively vetting and investigating the potential of the project that you are considering giving your money. This is a time consuming and fairly mundane activity which requires a lot of reading and filtering the good from the bad. Hard to do if you also have a day job, family, or other commitments to juggle. Some investors take a more ‘scattergun’ approach to ICO’s thinking that if they buy into 10 or more (with just limited DD on each one) then the good ones will outweigh the losses and the investor will end up in a net profit position.

现在，许多ICO投资者的主要做法是尽职调查，它是对你要准备投资的项目可行性进行调查研究的一种方式。这相当耗时，而且是一件很乏味枯燥的事；这需要读大量的白皮书，从坏的中筛选出好的项目。如果你有正常的工作，需要照顾家人，就很难去做这样的事。一些投资者对ICO的态度是采取撒网的方式：如果投资10个以上的项目，每个只是做一点有限的尽职调查，那么一个好的项目带来的回报会超过其余项目的投资损失，获得不错的收益。

There is no right or wrong way to approach ICO investment, but my advice would simply be to DYOR (do your own research) and make sure you believe in the project. Then try to get an early allocation in a project that looks viable, has a good team, shows signs of community support and has at least a demo of their product available to see.

进行ICO投资的方法没有正确或错误之说，但是我的建议很简单，就是自己做研究，相信自己投资的项目。然后，试着早一点把资金投入在那些看起来可行的、团队可信的、有社区支持的项目，而且至少这些项目有个能看到效果的Demo。

Ones to avoid — anonymous teams, no demo product, short or ‘cookie cutter’ whitepaper, ‘me too’ concepts which have already been seen many times, founders who retain majority of coins or a just poorly presented website with minimal info.

需要避开的有：匿名的团队，没有演示样例，简短或千篇一律的白皮书，一些已经看过好多次的类似概念，创始人保留大量代币，项目介绍内容非常少的网站。

When it comes time to get your ICO coin, make sure to transfer it to your own wallet and choose your time to sell. Maybe hold some and sell some at the start of exchange trading, to average down your investment risk. If you believe in the project then it would make sense to keep some of your coins for a longer term investment and who knows it might be worth 500x someday!

说到获得ICO代币，确保把它转到你自己的钱包软件，择机卖掉。或者在交易所上了这个代币时，持有一些，卖掉一些，拉低你的投资风险。如果你认同这个项目，那么就选择长期地持有一些，谁知道哪天它就可能带来500倍的回报呢！

Good luck out there and stay safe

祝你好运，注意安全。
