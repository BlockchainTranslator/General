The cryptocurrency market has been growing at an exponential pace and making a number of people very rich. But is it all about making money? The technology underlying cryptocurrencies – called Blockchain technology – has the potential to change our lives for the better. What does the crypto world have in store for you? Here are 4 reasons why you should get on board and invest in cryptocurrencies. 
加密货币市场发展得越来越快，一些人因此发了大财。但这仅仅是关于赚钱吗？作为加密货币底层技术的区块链技术有望将改善人类的生活。加密货币会给你带来什么？以下是4个原因告诉你为什么你需要上车来投资加密货币。

1.Returns You Could Never Have Imagined你未曾想象过的回报。

Let us just compare Bitcoin’s rate of return with that of S&P 500 stocks, which is the leading indicator of the performance of U.S. equities from the year 2016.I wish I can say that we’re dreaming. But we’re not. Say you invested 12,000. But if you invested in Bitcoin, you would be worth a whopping $60,000. Let’s choose another prominent coin: Ethereum. 
我们就拿Bitcoin的收益率和S&P500来比较一下吧。假如说，2016年你在美国股市投资了10000美金，到现在你的总投资价值为12000美金。但是，如果你投资的是Bitcoin，那么你现在会有60000美金。我们来看看另一种更显著的Ethereum.

This is even crazier. And this chart is from the start of this year. If you’d invested in Ethereum, your investment would have increased by a multiple of 46. If you had invested 470,000 in a span of 6 months. Think about it. These kinds of returns are impossible to acquire within the realm of traditional investments. 
这个更疯狂。表格显示的是从2017年开始，如果投资了Ethereum，那么它会增长46倍。如果你投了10000美金，那么6个月内你将会拥有470000美金。这些收益在传统投资中是不可能实现的。

Bitcoin and Ethereum may be the biggest coins now, but there are hundreds of coins which can achieve similar or even better rates of return. Each coin has a specific purpose or solves a particular issue. 
Bitcoin和Ethereum也许是现在价值最大的币，但是还有上百种其他种类的币，可以为你带来同样的甚至是更好的收益率。每种币都有具体的目的或者可以解决一个特殊的问题。

However, a word of caution: Make sure sufficient due diligence is undertaken before investing. Cryptos can be highly volatile and they are at the stage of infancy; there’s a possibility that many coins may fail or are downright scams. 
然而，说句谨慎的话：投资之前一定要做好尽职调查。加密货币有非常大的波动性，而且它们现在处于行业初始阶段；很多币存在失败或者是骗局的可能性。

2.Huge Growth Potential巨大的增长潜力。

The crypto world is extremely intimidating, due to the complexities in understanding the technology. The use of technical computing terms can confuse and deter outsiders. This is the main reason why many stay away from Cryptos. In addition, it can be a real challenge navigating through the ecosystem; from opening an exchange account, to sending coin transactions, to managing one’ private wallet for safekeeping. 
理解加密货币的科技是复杂的，使得这个领域非常恐怖。计算机术语使很多人对此领域感到困惑并敬而远之。此外，从注册交易所账户，到发送货币交易，再到管理个人钱包，跑通整个流程也是极具挑战的。

The fact that the Cryptos intimidate most people is the very reason why you would want to be in it. Jumping on the bandwagon earlier than most would give you an edge, both in terms of potential gains and experience. It can be a steep learning curve, but it would all be worth it. Once there’s adequate mainstream coverage on cryptos, the masses will start pouring in, purely because the rates of returns are relatively astounding! 
事实上，加密货币吓倒了大部分人恰恰就是你为什么你想要加入进来的原因。比大部分人早上车会给你带来潜在收益、经验两个方面的优势。这可能是一个很曲折的学习过程，但一切都是值得的。一旦加密货币受到大部分人的关注，普通大众将会涌入进来，因为它的回报率太高了。

3.Ideological Empowerment意识形态授权

If you’re not a big fan of the government, the big banks or monopolistic corporation, then cryptos are perfect for you. Let’s face it, humans are used to a central authority– in the form of a government, an institution, or any authority – that set rules to dictate the way things should be done. What if the tables are turned, and the masses have a real say in how things should operate? Now that is a truly democratic ecosystem. 
如果你不热衷于政府，大型银行或者垄断性的公司，那么加密货币就非常适合你。承认了吧，人类习惯于中心化的权力-可能是政府、机构或者是任何可以支配事情发展的权力。如果扭转一下这个局面，那么大多数人将会有说话的权力。这才是真正的民主。

The decentralization of cryptocurrencies democratizes traditional powers and empowers the masses. No more shall you depend on financial institutions for transferring money that comes with an exorbitant fee. There are many coins – most notably Bitcoin – that allows users to transfer money to anyone at any location with a fraction of the fees. Not only that, having private wallets to store your coins gives you full control of your money. It’s like managing your own bank; you decide your own rules. 
加密货币的去中心化可使传统的权力机构民主化并把权力赋予给大众。你再也不需要依赖收取高额手续费的金融机构来汇款。有很多种币使用户可以以小额手续费在任何地点给任何人汇款。不仅如此，有一个私人钱包存储自己的币可以让你对自己的钱有完全的掌控。这就如同管理你自己的银行；规则你来定。

Moreover, the nature of a decentralized economy powered by Blockchain naturally aligns the economic incentives of participants. This means that actors with bad intentions would find it extremely unproductive and expensive to attack or compromise the system, as the amount of resources needed to do so would be astronomical. Instead of wasting their resources to compromise the system without gaining any incentive, the logical thing to do is to contribute their resources to strengthen the security of the system (a process called “mining”). They would, therefore, be entitled to economic rewards for doing so. Anyone can take part in the network by contributing resources and earn coins for the commensurate work that you put in. The capacity for any person to participate and power the entire system is the nature of decentralization. 
而且，区块链所驱动的去中心化经济的本质与参与者的经济刺激是相互关联的。这意味着具有不良意图的参与者们会发现攻击或者损害系统是无效且昂贵的，因为这样做将会耗费巨大的资源。与其耗费巨大资源来损害系统却没有半点收货，倒不如把资源贡献给系统来加强系统的安全性（这个过程被称作“挖矿”）。因此，他们会被称作旷工而受到奖励。每个人都可以通过共享资源的形式加入网络并赢得代币。任何人都可以参与并为整个网络附能，这是去中心化的本质。

4.Bragging Rights吹牛的权力

Imagine having the opportunity to be part of the internet revolution in the 1990s. It was a perfect opportunity for you to acquire a vast amount of wealth and more importantly, bragging rights. The rights exclusive only to the initial investors and backers of the revolutionary technology, and that which could serve as your lifetime legacy. That recognition goes beyond material wealth and it really is currently at your fingertips. How many can claim the rights of being the few that took part in the development of a revolutionary part of human evolution? Very few. Cryptocurrencies are the gateway to that legacy. 
想象一下，有机会参与90年代的互联网革命。那对你来说是一个获取大量财富的绝佳机会。更重要的是，吹牛的权力。这些权利只属于这项革命性科技的初期投资者及支持者。那种赞誉胜过物质财富，目前它触手可及。人类进化的革命性时刻，有多少人能声称自己参与其中？非常少。加密货币就是其中的一扇门。

All in All总结 
The crypto world is a blossoming to be a real game-changer that could change the way we do things. As we speak, applications are being developed to disrupt the current status quo, for the better. Imagine having transparent access to government or organizational activity at your fingertips, or allowing part of your computing power to be shared in the advancement of key scientific and medical projects. A decentralized system allows the masses to leverage each other’s resources and qualities to uplift the community. It is a force of good. Additionally, you can also get very rich investing in the ecosystem too. So what are you waiting for? 
加密货币正百花齐放，可以改变我们的生活方式。此时，诸多应用正在被开发，来改善目前的状况。想象一下政府和机构活动的透明化，或者想象一下把自己的一部分算力分享给重要的科研及医学项目。一个去中心化的系统使得大众可以影响彼此的资源从而推动社区，这是一种正能量。此外，你也可以在投资的过程中变得非常富有。那么，你还在等什么呢？
