After a year of explosive price growth, forks, failed forks and more, there is much that can be said about bitcoin in 2017. Massive strides were taken, and much has been learned. However, as we push further into uncharted waters, what happens from this point onward continues to be just as divisive a topic as ever.

在经历了一年的爆炸式增长以及分叉，分叉失败等之后，在2017年比特币有很多可以讨论的事情。我们取得了巨大的进步，而且已经学到了很多。然而，随着我们进一步深入到未知的领域，从这一点开始的事情将继续像以往一样引起争议。

Underlying both much of the year’s drama and continued future uncertainty is a simple question: Can bitcoin scale as it continues to capture mainstream attention, or will it become a victim of its own success, with alternative cryptocurrencies waiting in the wings to overtake it?

Of course, no one can honestly answer this question with total certainty. Predicting the future is a messy business, because the future is constantly in flux. It is not and cannot be fixed or predetermined. Rather, the future is being shaped and created gradually in the here and now by those unsatisfied by the present.

今年大部分时间的戏剧性和持续的未来不确定性背后隐藏着一个简单的问题:比特币能否继续吸引主流关注，还是会成为自身成功的牺牲品，而其他的加密货币能否超越它?

当然，没有人能完全肯定地回答这个问题。预测未来是一件棘手的事情，因为未来是不断变化的。它不是，也不可能是固定的或预先确定的。相反，未来是由现在和对现在存在不满的人逐渐塑造和创造的。

As George Bernard Shaw wrote:

>"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man."

So, as we reflect on a breathtaking year and ponder what challenges the future may hold, it’s worth paying special attention to those unreasonable men and women who are doing the creating.

正如George Bernard Shaw所写的:

>"理性的人适应世界;不理性的人坚持要使世界适应自己。因此，所有的进步都取决于不理性的人。”

因此，当我们回顾这一令人激动的一年，思考未来可能会面临怎样的挑战时，值得特别关注的是那些不理性的正在创造新事物的人们（男男女女）。

## Scaling bitcoin
## 扩展比特币

At the beginning of November, one of the longest running and recognized technical conferences in the blockchain sector hosted its 2017 conference in partnership with The University of Stanford: Scaling Bitcoin.

在十一月初，在区块链领域举办的时间最长，得到认可的技术会议之一，与斯坦福大学合作举办了2017年会议：Scaling Bitcoin。


For the fourth time, Scaling Bitcoin brought together academics, developers and entrepreneurs from across the blockchain ecosystem, many of whom have been in the thick of cryptocurrency ideas and development for years. With this long and deep experience comes a sense of perspective and order of priorities that shouldn’t be ignored.

Scaling Bitcoin的第四次会议聚集了整个区块链生态系统中的学者，开发者和企业家，他们中的许多人多年来一直密切关注着加密货币的想法和发展。有了这个漫长而深刻的经验，就有了一种不容忽视的优先视角和顺序。

For those looking to the future of cryptocurrency and wondering what’s preventing us from getting there, there’s no better place to start.

对于那些想要了解加密货币的未来，想知道是什么阻止了我们去的发展的人，没有比这更好的地方可以开始了。

Immediately notable to CoinDesk Editor-in-Chief Peter Rizzo was that despite this rare concentration of industry veterans, discussion largely ignored much of the latest hot button drama dominating the cryptocurrency news cycle.

While the conference stayed true to name with presentations focusing on possible Bitcoin Core optimizations and layer 2 proposals, the controversial topics of forks and block size were seldom touched on during the course of the conference. Participants showed little apprehension for seemingly pressing controversies such as the Segwit2X fork, and most attendees, including myself, were confident that it would be dead upon arrival.

CoinDesk主编彼得里佐的一则引人注目的消息是，尽管业内人士罕见地集中在一起，但讨论基本上忽略了最新的热门话题——主宰加密货币的周期。

尽管会议的主题是关于可能可行的比特币核心优化和第2层提议的介绍，但在会议过程中很少涉及到分叉和区块大小这一有争议的话题。与会者对诸如Segwit2X分叉之类的看似紧迫的争议没有什么顾虑，大多数与会者，包括我自己，都相信在抵达后它将会死去。

A belief and attitude that was quickly validated when 2X was canceled the very week after the end of the conference.

As a result, and for better or worse, bitcoin would not increase its base block size. The incompatible vision of much larger block size limits for bitcoin would for now embody itself only in the bitcoin cash blockchain. This has led to many predictions that bitcoin cash and other alternative cryptocurrencies will overtake bitcoin as its block size limit becomes a bottleneck for adoption.

在会议结束后的一个星期，当2X被取消时，这种信念和态度很快就被证实了。

因此，无论是好是坏，比特币不会增加其基础块的规模。目前，比特币的区块更大的比特币区块大小限制，目前只体现在比特币现金的区块链中。这引发了许多人的预测，即比特币现金和其他替代加密货币将取代比特币，因为比特币的规模（区块大小）限制成为了其被采用的瓶颈。

With only a few notable exceptions, the majority of Scaling Bitcoin’s attendees did not indicate that they found this to be a notable concern. However, that is not to say that attendees were not vocal about any pressing technological challenges. If the wide ranging topics of presentations were of any indication, far from it. But one way or another all participants did agree on a single, much wider, and more fundamental concern for scaling this still nascent ecosystem: a drought of quality developer talent.

除了少数几个明显的例外，比特币的大多数与会者并没有表示他们认为这是一个值得关注的问题。然而，这并不是说与会者不会对任何紧迫的技术挑战发表意见。如果广泛的演讲主题有任何暗示的话，那就远非如此了。但无论如何，所有与会者都同意，在这个仍处于萌芽阶段的生态系统中，一个单一、更广泛、更根本的问题是:一场优质开发人员的旱灾（缺乏）。

As developer and attendee Jimmy Song puts it plainly:

>"Training more developers is the biggest bottleneck in the ecosystem."

It is very appropriate then that besides the location of Stanford, also unique to this year’s Scaling Bitcoin was a new attempt by its organizers to directly tackle this problem.

正如开发者和出席者Jimmy Song所说的那样:

>“培训更多的开发者是生态系统中最大的瓶颈。”

除了斯坦福大学的地理位置以外，今年的Scaling Bitcoin也有其独到之处，这是它的组织者试图直接解决这一问题的新尝试。

## Bitcoin Edge Dev++
## 比特币边缘Dev + +

The Dev++ workshop was established by the Scaling Bitcoin organizers with the sole mission of educating and helping to onboard aspiring blockchain developers, and it accomplished this with studded star power.

For the inaugural Dev++ program, dozens of participants attended presentations and guided demonstrations from well-known names from across the industry. These included the aforementioned Jimmy Song, Bitcoin Core contributor John Newberry, MIT's Thaddeus Dryja, and many others.

“开发者++工作室”是由Scaling Bitcoin的组织者建立的，他们唯一的使命是教育和帮助那些有抱负的区块链开发者。

在首届“开发者++”项目中，数十名参与者参加了来自业界知名人士的演示和指导演示。这些包括前面提到的Jimmy Song，比特币的核心贡献者John Newberry，麻省理工学院的John Newberry，以及其他许多人。

This ensemble of technical experts delivered a crash course covering everything from the cryptographic fundamentals of bitcoin, to the theory and implementation of second-layer networks. The latter featured a live and interactive demonstration of the Lighting Network software on testnet by Dryja himself, co-author of the original white paper.

Perhaps as insightful as the Dev++ demonstrations themselves, however, was an off hand comment by Dryja which surprised some attentive students, and told them all they needed to know about the need for the event in the first place.

这组技术专家提供了一门速成课程，涵盖了从比特币的加密原理到第二层网络的理论和实现。Dryja本人是最初的白皮书的作者者，他在测试网络上进行了实时互动演示。

然而，也许是在开发人员的演示本身那样具有深刻的洞察力，Dryja对一些细心的学生感到惊讶，并且告诉他们所有他们需要首先了解事件的必要性。

When asked whether a minor Lightning Network feature had been implemented yet, Dryja responded:

>"No. I had the idea over a year ago and just haven’t had the time to implement it... But it’s all open source so if anyone wants to make a pull request, like, please. That would be awesome. I just haven’t had the time."

This playful yet earnest response reveals the true bottleneck for scaling bitcoin and blockchain technology. Like all things it is time, the scarcest of all resources. We have no control over the passage of time, but what we can do is better leverage it. Finding, encouraging and developing more of those unreasonable individuals whom all progress depends upon is the only way to bring the future closer and faster.

当被问及是否已经实施了一个小型闪电网络功能时，Dryja回应说：

>“不，我一年前有过这个想法，只是没有时间来实施它...但是这都是开源的，所以如果有人想提出pull请求，那就太可怕了。我只是没有时间而已。“

这种有趣而又认真的回应揭示了扩大比特币和区块链技术的真正瓶颈。像所有事情一样，是时间，最稀缺的资源。我们无法控制时间的流逝，但我们可以做的只是更好地利用它。发现，鼓励和发展更多不理性的个人，这些人都是进步所依赖的，这是使未来更加紧密和发展更快的唯一途径。

As Lightning Network developer Jack Mallers writes on reddit "... I can say that the only thing that can speed up Lightning is more engineers. I am the only dev behind Zap and I only spend time I can afford to spend. One more dev on Zap and myself officially full-time would make a world's difference."

This sentiment is echoed by the CEO of Lightning Elizabeth Stark who says: "Time! We need more hours in the day."

正如闪电网络开发者Jack Mallers在reddit上所写的那样:我可以说，唯一能加速闪电网络发展的东西就是更多的工程师。我是Zap背后唯一的一名开发者，我只花时间去消费。“我和我的正式全职工作将会给世界带来不同。”

这一观点得到了闪电网络的首席执行官伊丽莎白斯塔克的回应，他说:“时间！我们每天需要更多的时间。”

Indeed, the number of full-time developers working on such a widely anticipated technology may surprise you: "There are 10 or fewer full time developers working across all implementations of Lightning," says Stark. "Getting more contributors and people building out the protocol would certainly help move things along."

实际上，开发这样一种备受期待的技术的全职开发人员的数量可能会让你大吃一惊:“在所有的闪电网络实现中，有10个或更少的全职开发者，”斯塔克说。“让更多的贡献者和人们建立协议肯定有助于推动事情的发展。”
