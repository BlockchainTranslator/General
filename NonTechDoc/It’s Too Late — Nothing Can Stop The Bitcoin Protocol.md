It’s Too Late — Nothing Can Stop The Bitcoin Protocol

太迟了——没有什么可以阻挡比特币协议

I was in a Blockchain conference in Manila recently, and a bold statement was made by one of my co-panelists during a talk about the future of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain tech. He said, “We won’t be talking about Bitcoin in three years”.

最近我参加马尼拉（Manila）的一个区块链峰会，我的一位共同小组成员在谈论到加密货币和比特币技术未来的时候，做了一个大胆的声明。他说：“在三年之内我们都不会再讨论比特币”。



Perfectly captures my expression after hearing that statement

非常完美地捕捉到我听到这个言论后的表情

Ironically, also three years ago in 2014–15, when the price of Bitcoin was tumbling down, and all the rage in Wall Street was the magical “Blockchain technology”, this statement was made over and over again too. We are seeing it again today, this time not from the wall street types, but from the silicon valley/startup/tech people.

讽刺的是，也是在三年前（ 2014-15 年间），当比特币价格暴跌时，华尔街对神奇的“区块链技术”充满愤怒，这个言论曾经一次又一次地出现。今天我们又可以听到这种声音，但这次不是来自华尔街的精英，而是来自硅谷、创业公司、技术人员。

Well, I have a bold statement to make too.

那好吧，我也来做一个大胆的言论：

By the year 2028, the Bitcoin protocol will be the standard for secure and censorship-resistant value transactions on a global scale. As its network effect grows, multiple layers of applications will be built on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain, and the world will see value and commerce flow like never before. Money will flow like pure information — instant, secure, unfairly cheap, open, borderless, and programmable.

到 2028 年，比特币协议将在全球范围成为安全和抵制审查的价值交易的标准。随着网络效应的增长，多层应用将建立在比特币区块链顶层，世界将会见证前所未有的价值和商业流动。资金会像纯粹的信息那样流动——即时、安全、不可思议的廉价、开放、无边界和可编程实现。

We will no longer be sending money, we will be streaming money.

我们将不再发送金钱，而是流通金钱。

It is actually obvious once you truly grasp what the technology behind Bitcoin enables. And no, I am not talking about everyone’s favorite buzzword, “Blockchain”. I am talking about the Bitcoin protocol, of which the blockchain is merely a part of the system.

因为当你真正掌握比特币背后的技术能做什么的时候，这是显而易见的。但这里，我不讨论人人都喜欢谈论的流行语“区块链”。我讨论的是比特币协议，其中区块链仅仅是系统的一部分。

Bitcoin is simply a network of computers that constantly reach agreement over the state of a shared database.

比特币仅仅是基于共享数据库状态不断达成共识的电脑集群的一个网络。

- The network is made up of Nodes, which are actual computers running the Bitcoin software. As of today, there are about 10,000+ Nodes all over the world.
- They all reach agreement through a set of predetermined rules that cannot be changed without unanimous consensus among nodes. The rules keep every participant in sync and keep the integrity of the network intact.
- The shared database is the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a tamper-proof and public record of every transaction ever made in the history of Bitcoin, in chronological order, secure by proof-of-work. Because everybody is watching everybody else, no one can cheat.
- 这个网络由各个节点组成，这些节点是运行比特币软件的实体电脑。到目前为止，全世界范围内大概有 10,000+ 个结点。
- 它们都通过一系列预先设定好的规则来达成共识，这些规则在节点没有达成一致的情况下是不能改变的。这个规则保证了每个参与者保持同步状态并维护网络的完整性。
- 这个公开数据库就是比特币区块链，它按照时间戳顺序，由工作量证明保障，防止篡改并公开记录比特币历史上所有的交易信息。因为每个人相互监督，所以没人可以作弊。

The simple elegance of the Bitcoin protocol is what makes it work. With these three simple components, plus of course, bitcoins, the only currency accepted in the network, we now have the base protocol for peer-to-peer internet value transfers. The possibilities for new applications and protocols to be built on top of this base layer are endless. Things like Lightning Network, enabling near-instant and almost free transactions, are already a reality. Similar to how Uber or AirBnB were unimaginable just fifteen years ago, financial applications that are unimaginable now will emerge out of the permissionless innovation enabled by the open-source nature of Bitcoin software.

比特币协议的简单优雅就是它的工作原理。这三个简单的组成部分，当然啦，还要加上网络接受的唯一货币——比特币，我们现在就有了点对点互联网价值传输的基础协议。基于这个基础层创建新应用和协议的可能性是无限的。像闪电网络这种几乎即时和接近免费的应用已经成为现实。与短短十五年前优步（Uber）或者爱彼迎（AirBnB，译者注：这个中文名是官方钦定的......）是不可想象的情况很类似，现在无法想象的金融应用程序将从比特币软件开源的自然属性带来的无限可创新性中脱颖而出。

Death, Taxes, and Bitcoin

消亡，税收和比特币

“Which is why Bitcoin is an excellent idea. It fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. It is owned by the crowd, its users. And it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.” — Nassim Nicolas Taleb

“是哪一个因素促使比特币成为一个绝妙的构思？它满足了复杂系统的需求，不仅仅是因为它是一种加密货币，精确地来说是因为它没有所属者，没有哪一个权威可以决定它的命运。它属于大众，属于它的使用者。同时它现在有过去好几年的交易记录，这些足够让它有权按照自己的意愿生存发展下去。”—— Nassim Nicolas Taleb

Running non-stop for nine years, with almost zero financial loss on the chain itself, Bitcoin has become the most reliable and secure financial network in the world. When you send a valid Bitcoin transaction, you can bet the farm on it that it will be sent and that it will be received by your intended recipient. It’s right up there with death and taxes.

从不间断运行了九年，在链上几乎是零金钱损失，比特币已经成为了世界上最可靠最安全的金融网络。当你发送一笔有效的比特币交易，你完全可以打赌它一定会被发送，并且将会被你的预期收款方收到。它几乎接近死亡和税收。

It has been subject to every kind of attack ranging from network attacks, spamming, social attacks, government crackdown, FUD attacks, hash power and mining attacks, contentious hard fork attacks, and more recently, brand hijacking from unscrupulous groups that spend exorbitant amounts of money to try and destroy Bitcoin. All the attacks have failed, and the network became more resilient as a result.

它曾经受到过网络攻击、垃圾邮件攻击、社交攻击、政府打击、心理战术攻击、哈希算力和挖矿攻击、备受争议的硬分叉攻击，最近还遭受了无耻群体劫持品牌的攻击，这些群体花费高额金钱想要摧毁比特币。但所有的攻击都以失败告终，结果反而使网络变得更加具有抵抗性。

Diminishing Risks

风险降低

The Lindy Effect states that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy for things like technology. Nine years after its inception, Bitcoin has overcome most major risks that would pose a threat to the integrity of the protocol and the network. With each passing day, with each block added to the chain, the confidence in the network increases, and its network effect grows stronger.

  林迪效应表明：像技术这类事物，每额外存在一段时间，都意味着它的预期寿命会变得更长。启动后过了九年，比特币已经克服了大部分会对协议和网络完整性造成威胁的主要风险。每过去一天，每在链上增加一个区块，人们对网络的信心也随之增加，同时网络效应也变得更加强大。

Protocol Flaw

协议缺陷

One of the earliest risks was that there was a fatal flaw on the protocol level of Bitcoin. In 2009–2010, when Bitcoin was in its infancy, people were not really sure about how robust the software would be, simply because it has not faced any major challenges yet. By 2011, the best engineers and cryptographers in the world knew that this risk had been reduced to almost zero.

早期风险之一是比特币在协议层面上存在着致命的缺陷。在 2009-2010 年，当比特币正出襁褓时期，人们不太确定这些软件的鲁棒性到底有多强，单纯因为它那时候也没有遭到那么多主要的挑战。到了 2011 年，世界上最好的工程师和密码学家都知道了这个风险已经降到几乎为零。

Government Risks

监管风险

Going into 2013, during the second Bitcoin hype-cycle, the greatest risk was from the governments of the world — what if the US banned Bitcoin? What if governments made it illegal to own Bitcoin? The New York Bitlicense set an ominous precedent, but by the end of 2013, at least in free and democratic countries around the world, this risk had gone down to zero as well.

来到 2013 年，在第二次比特币炒作周期期间，最大的风险是来自世界的监管——假如美国禁止比特币，那怎么办？假如政府宣布持有比特币犯法，怎么办？纽约的 Bitlicense 组织开创了一个不详的先例，但到了 2013 年年底，至少在全世界自由和民主的国家，这个风险也几乎降到零了。

Secondary Market Challenges

来自二级市场的挑战

And then there was the Mt. Gox hack in 2014. What was then the largest and most popular Bitcoin exchange in the world had been hacked, losing over half a billion dollars, and compromising the integrity of the fledgling cryptocurrency markets. The risk of losing the valuable secondary markets for trading Bitcoin was looming over everyone’s heads, but common sense prevailed, and by 2017 we already had numerous regulated and liquid cryptocurrency exchange platforms everywhere in the world, with Bitcoin as the crypto-reserve currency, following industry best practices and better security protocols.

接着是 2014 年的门头沟黑客事件。在这次事件中，世界上最大最受欢迎的比特币交易所被黑，损失超过五亿美金，影响了人们对新兴加密货币市场的信心。每个人都或多或少面临着失去交易比特币的珍贵二级市场的风险，但比特币的共识逐渐盛行，到了 2017 年，我们在全球各地都有众多符合监管和流动的加密货币交易平台，它们遵行行业最高标准和更好的安全协议，把比特币作为加密储备货币。

Social and Technical Scalability Risks

社交和技术可扩展性风险

The last challenge Bitcoin faced last year, in 2017, was the risk of a major hard fork splitting the network and ultimately compromising its integrity. A contentious hard fork eventually did happen, but it did not have the expected results. After the fork, Bitcoin rallied to new all-time highs, rising over 1000% in just three short months. The social scalability of Bitcoin had been tested, and it passed with flying colors. The users, nodes, and miners that make up the Bitcoin network had chosen the version of Bitcoin that they wanted to support, and the market responded positively.

比特币面对的最后一个挑战是上一年，这个风险是在 2017 年的硬分叉：分叉网络从主网脱离，这也会影响人们对它的信心。最终，备受争议的硬分叉还是发生了，但是它没有预期的（不良）效果。反而在分叉后的三个月，比特币价格反弹到历史新高，在刚过去的短短三个月内涨幅超过 1000% 。比特币的社会可扩展性考核已经通过了，并且成绩优异。组成比特币网络的用户、节点和矿工选择了他们支持的比特币版本，并且各自的市场反应也很积极。

Although the root cause of the split in the network was transactional scalability, Bitcoin still works well today, with transaction fees at all-time lows because base layer improvements like Segwit have reached 30% adoption.

虽然导致网络分叉的根本原因是交易的可扩展性，但比特币到今天仍然表现很好，并且交易费用达到了历史新低，因为像隔离见证这样的基础层改进进度已达 30% 。

Second layer applications like the Lightning network will be more than enough to facilitate transactions on the scale of VISA and other payment networks. The engineers that maintain and upgrade the software are hard at work with improvements on every aspect of the Bitcoin protocol.

第二层例如像闪电网络这样的应用将足以促进交易规模达到 VISA 和其它支付网络的规模。维护和升级软件的工程师正在努力改进比特币协议的各个方面。

Future Challenges

未来的挑战

Just like any new technology, there will be more challenges in these early development and adoption phases. The fact that Bitcoin challenges the status quo and breaks the lucrative positions of middlemen in the financial world is enough reason to assume that these attacks will continue and increase in intensity and in scope. The beauty of decentralized protocols is that they are not just resilient to attacks, they are Anti-fragile.

就像任何新科技一样，在早期开发和应用阶段都会遇到更多的挑战。比特币挑战现状和在金融领域打破中间商的有利地位这一事实足以证明，这些攻击无论在强度和广度上都会持续和增加。但分布式协议的美妙之处在于它们不仅能够抵抗攻击，而且还具有顽强生命力。

Could Bitcoin fail? Yes, nothing is impossible. The odds are pretty low at this point, given the examples I have given above, but nothing is certain. The thing is, it may fail in its current form, but technology is fluid and software adapts. Bitcoin cannot be uninvented. It is here to stay.

那么比特币有可能失败吗？有，没有什么是不可能的。基于我上文给出的例子，现在看起来这个可能性是非常低的，但没有什么是确定的。事实是目前的形式可能会失败，但技术是可以升级的，软件也可以调整。比特币不可能不被挖出，它就存在于这里。

In the words of Nassim Nicolas Taleb, “It may fail; but then it will be easily reinvented as we now know how it works.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

正如 Nassim Nicolas Taleb 所说的：“它可能失败；但它可以很简单地被重新创造出来，因为我们已经明白了它的工作原理。”
