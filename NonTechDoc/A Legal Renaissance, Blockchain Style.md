The year that just ended was transformational.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency entered the common vernacular. Previously, my family and friends, many of whom likely viewed me as earnest and well meaning – yet nonetheless tinfoil hat-wearing – politely tolerated my attempts to regale them with tales of how "blockchain can change the world." But now, dinner conversations regularly revolve around digital tokens and exchanges – and the ever-popular question, "Why didn't you tell us sooner?"  I find myself smiling at the realization that, now, sometimes I am the one at the table who tries to change the subject when cryptocurrency come up.

刚刚结束的一年是转型的一年。

区块链和加密货币进入了普通的人的世界。以前，我的家人和朋友，他们中的许多人可能只是认为我是认真的，也是出于好意的——但尽管如此，他们还是很有礼貌地容忍了我试图讲“区块链可以改变世界”的故事来给他们听。但是现在，晚餐的谈话经常围绕着数字货币和交流——还有一个很流行的问题，“你为什么不早点告诉我们呢?”“我发现自己正微笑着意识到，现在，有时我在饭桌上，当谈论到加密货币时，我会试图改变这个话题。

Those exchanges aside, geeking out about blockchain remains one of my favorite pastimes, and, happily, in 2017, I had the pleasure of meeting many like-minded people.  This time last year, however, I had no idea that many of my closest crypto-collaborators, my blockchain sounding boards, and, truly, some of my best friends, would be lawyers I'd meet in the market.

抛开这些不谈，对区块链的了解仍然是我最喜欢的消遣之一，而且，很高兴的是，在2017年，我有幸见到了许多志趣相投的人。然而，去年的这个时候，我不知道我最亲密的加密领域合作者、我的区块链的董事会，以及我真正的最好的朋友，将会是我在市场上遇到的律师。

Lawyers at large firms, small firms, no firms, in-house. Lawyers from across the United States, and from around the world. Whether formed in think tanks and legal working groups, or forged on social media platforms, like LinkedIn, those blockchain legal relationships have proven to be meaningful, real and enormously valuable.

无论是来自大事务所，小事务所甚至不在事务所的律师。来自美国各地的律师，来自世界各地的律师。无论是在智囊团和法律工作小组中，还是在社交媒体平台上，如LinkedIn，都证明了这些区块链的法律关系是有意义的、真实的、极具价值的。

Perhaps that is my take-away: 2017 was the year that individual lawyers and law firms got over themselves and worked together, at least in the blockchain space.

My prediction: In 2018, the speed and scale of technological developments will make non-traditional legal teaming not just nice to have, but critical.

或许这就是我的结论:2017年，个人律师和律师事务所互相独立工作的时代已经结束，至少在区块链领域是如此。

我的预测是:在2018年，技术发展的速度和规模将使非传统的法律合作，这不仅是有益的，而且是至关重要的。

## Lawyer as artist?
## 律师是艺术家吗？

In recent years, the legal profession has not exactly been known for its imagination or its cross-firm collaboration.

Lawyers as a group are famously risk averse – intense legal training designed to illuminate potential hazards and liabilities also may make it hard to un-see or look beyond those identified risks. Lawyers often are applauded – or, at least, self-applauded – for their abilities to guide entrepreneurs down well-worn deal paths, sticking to precedent, doing things the way they are supposed to be done.

近年来，法律界并没有以其想象或跨公司的合作而闻名。

作为律师团体，众所周知的风险规避——旨在阐明潜在风险和责任的严格法律培训，也可能使人们难以看清或规避那些已确定的风险。律师们常常受到称赞——或者至少是自我表扬——因为他们有能力引导企业家们沿着陈旧的交易路线，不要想着开创先例，按照他们应该做的方式来做事。

In fact, a more experienced lawyer once cautioned me, "the last thing any client needs is a creative securities lawyer."

But 2017 was a year that turned this and other conventional law firm wisdom on its head, at least in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. For me and likely many other lawyers, this was the year that I rediscovered a life of the mind and the law became fascinating and fun again.

事实上，一位经验丰富的律师曾告诫我:“任何客户最不需要的就是有创意的证券律师。”

但2017年证明了这是错误的并且其他传统的法律事务所需要发挥其智慧，至少在区块链和加密货币领域是如此。对我和其他许多律师来说，这是我重新发现新思想的一年，而法律又变得迷人又有趣。

At the end of 2016, the idea that the next twelve months would bring with them more blockchain and crypto-related work than one law firm, or even several law firms, could possibly handle, may have sounded to many like a wild and unrealistic hope. To the contrary, in 2016, at least one major financial institution had openly expressed an intention to develop smart contracts with a goal of reducing legal spend.

在2016年年底，未来12个月将会带来更多的区块链和加密相关的工作不是一家律师事务所，甚至几家律师事务所都能处理的。这可能听起来像是一种疯狂而不切实际的想法。相反，在2016年，至少有一家大型金融机构公开表示有意开发智能合约，目的是降低法律支出。

Could any of us have predicted how many new legal questions and theories would arise, or how many old and supposedly settled areas of the law would awaken and pose exciting new puzzles? Technological innovations and the proliferation of token sales and cryptocurrency trading have transformed deal planning into veritable law school issue-spotting exams.

我们能不能预测出有多少新的法律问题和理论会出现，又或者有多少古老的和被认为是固定的法律领域会被唤醒并构成令人兴奋的新难题?技术创新和代币销售和加密货币交易的激增，使交易计划变成了名副其实的法学院入学考试。

Who knew that technologists and founders would be discussing the Howey test at cocktail parties, that legal panels would be standing room only, or that the SEC's Cyber Unit would exist, let alone achieve a sort of celebrity status?

谁知道技术人员和创始人会在鸡尾酒会上讨论Howey测试，法律小组只会站在房间里，或者SEC的网络部门会存在，更别提达到某种名流的地位了？

Alongside many brilliant founders, we lawyers in the crypto world have been given the tremendous opportunity and privilege, and the awesome responsibility, of being on the legal front lines of this exciting new ecosystem.  We get to interpret and sometimes even shape the various regulatory frameworks that will or may apply. Shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients and each other, we lawyers have been given the chance to be co-artists and co-designers of compliant and truly transformative technological and commercial endeavors, and not just deal jockeys and naysayers.

在许多才华横溢的创始人的陪同下，我们的律师在这个令人兴奋的新生态系统中，获得了巨大的机会和特权，以及令人敬畏的责任。我们得到理解，有时甚至会形成各种可能适用的监管框架。与我们的客户和我们彼此肩并肩，我们的律师已经有机会成为合作艺术家和共同设计师，他们是顺从发展的、真正具有变革意义的技术和商业的合作伙伴，而不仅仅是交易骑师和唱反调的人。

## New legal models
## 新的法律模式

What has driven so many lawyers to band together as thoughtful, well intentioned allies?

Is it risk aversion? Partially. Many responsible lawyers may hesitate to give legal advice about novel questions without seeking the views of others whom they respect. Few lawyers may want to risk being the outlier, giving out-of-step advice. There may be a perceived safety in numbers.

是什么促使如此多的律师团结在一起成为有思想的，善意的盟友？

这是避险情绪吗？部分原因。许多负责任的律师可能会毫不犹豫地就新的问题提出法律意见，而不征求他们尊重的其他人的意见。很少有律师会冒这个险成为局外人，提出不切实际的建议。团结在一起的话，在数量上可能有安全感。

Is it a matter of self-selection? In other words, are those lawyers who are most deeply immersed in the blockchain community naturally more open to new experiences, more collaborative, creative, and trusting, more inquisitive? Possibly. (Admittedly, as one of those lawyers, I kind of like that idea, because it paints a favorable picture. We all like to be special.)

In my view, however, these collaborative legal communities and relationships are emerging because they work and, I'd argue, are necessary for lawyers to continue to provide meaningful legal advice.

这是自我抉择的问题吗?换句话说，那些深深沉浸在区块链社区的律师们自然会更乐于接受新的体验、更协作、更有创意、更有信任、更有好奇心吗?可能。(诚然，作为一名律师，我很喜欢这种想法，因为它描绘了一幅有利的图景。我们都喜欢与众不同。)

然而，在我看来，这些合作的法律社区和关系正在浮现，因为它们起作用，而且我认为，律师们必须继续提供有意义的法律建议。

In the face of rapidly developing, expanding universe-scale innovations and ecosystems, we cannot go it alone. Even a single token sale, for instance, typically requires a team of lawyers from multiple jurisdictions, covering myriad legal content areas – among others, securities, commodities, money transmitter and other financial services, investment company and investment advisor, broker-dealer, tax and intellectual property – and many, if not all, of those legal content areas are changing or being re-examined in real time.

面对快速发展的、不断扩大的规模创新和生态系统，我们不能单独行动。甚至一个令牌出售,例如,从多个司法管辖区通常需要一个律师团队,涵盖了无数法律内容区域——其中包括证券、大宗商品、资金投入和其他金融服务、投资公司和投资顾问,经纪自营商,税收和知识产权,很多,如果没有全部覆盖的话,这些法律内容区域可能正在改变或被重新审视。

Fortunately for the crypto community, many talented lawyers have been brave enough to take stands and make them public, resulting in groundbreaking legal analyses and proposals – including "A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens," "The SAFT Project:  Toward a Compliant Token Sale Framework," "Not So Fast – Risks Relating to the Use of a “SAFT” for Token Sales” and “Conceptual Framework for Legal and Risk Assessment of Blockchain Crypto Property (BCP)."

对于加密社区来说，幸运的是，许多有才华的律师已经足够勇敢地采取立场并公开表态，从而开创了法律分析和建议 - 包括“区块链代币证券法框架”，“SAFT项目：面向代币的兼容销售框架”，“没那么快 - 与使用“SAFT”进行代币销售相关的风险”和“区块链加密属性（BCP）法律和风险评估的概念框架”。

These are not mere vanity projects. In a legal landscape filled with risk and few bright lines, we still need to provide practical advice to our clients now.

Rather than analytically wrestling alone with, for example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's The DAO enforcement action or Munchee cease and desist order, by understanding, critiquing and building upon our legal peers’ views, we arguably collectively can come to better reasoned views, and do so more quickly. Our learning in this space is incremental; why not build a knowledge ladder together and climb it?

这不只是一个表面光鲜的项目。在充满风险和鲜明线条的法律环境中，我们仍然需要向我们的客户提供切实可行的建议。

例如，美国证券交易委员会的“DAO执法行动”或“Munchee停止命令”，而不是通过分析和辩解，通过理解、批评和建立我们的法律同行的观点，我们可以共同得出更合理的观点，并更快地做出反应。我们在这个领域的学习是循序渐进的;为什么不一起建立一个知识阶梯并爬上去呢?

Perspective sharing among lawyers (and interested non-lawyers) may take place in working groups (like the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance), "think tanks" like Wharton RegTech, panel discussions, LinkedIn posts or even just quick calls to across town (or across-the-world) colleagues or so-called competitors. To my mind, it matters less how these discussions take place than that they take place.

Blockchain technology has enabled us to form new communities that transcend geographic, socioeconomic and other traditional boundaries.  Maybe it makes sense that the old, siloed law firm models need to evolve, as well.

律师(和感兴趣的非律师)之间的观点共享可能发生在工作小组(如华尔街的区块链联盟)、“智库”，如沃顿的RegTech、小组讨论、LinkedIn帖子，甚至是对整个城镇(或跨界)的同事或所谓的竞争对手的快速呼叫。在我看来，这些讨论如何发生并不重要。

区块链技术使我们能够形成超越地理、社会经济和其他传统界限的新社区。或许，旧的、孤立的法律公司模式也需要发展，这也许也是有一定道理的。

We are experiencing a technological tidal wave of new business models and novel legal questions, and regulators, market participants and lawyers all are trying to navigate the current.  The entire blockchain ecosystem arguably benefits when lawyers focus some of their energies outward, beyond their individual firms – advancing legal discussion and theory and grappling together to interpret and apply legal frameworks – rather than solely inward.

This shift in priority from maximizing at all costs an individual firm’s competitive advantage to developing a shared, industry-wide understanding may yield powerful economic, intellectual and interpersonal benefits, just as blockchain technology itself promises.

我们正在经历一场新的商业模式和新的法律问题的技术浪潮，监管机构、市场参与者和律师都在试图把握当前的趋势。整个区块链生态系统可以说是有益的，因为律师把他们的精力集中在他们的个人公司之外——推进法律讨论和理论，并努力解释和应用法律框架——而不仅仅是内在的独立发展。

如同区块链技术本身所承诺的那样，这种优先权从不惜一切代价最大化个人企业的竞争优势，发展到了全行业共同的理解进步，这可能产生强大的经济，智力和人际效益。

Aligning and realigning ourselves in flexible, nimble teams, across organizations and areas of expertise, may result in better thinking, more refined reasoning, a deeper combined knowledge reservoir. Not to mention more fun.

通过灵活，敏捷的团队，跨组织和专业领域的调整和重新组合，可能会产生更好的思维，更精细的推理，更深入的知识储备。更不用说更多的乐趣了。

## The future is fast
## 未来是快速的

In our blockchain space, the very speed of change appears to be accelerating.

What we tinfoil hat wearers hoped for in 2016 is beginning to happen. Bitcoin futures exist in our present.  Hedge funds are trading cryptocurrency. Governments around the globe are moving forward with blockchain technology initiatives. The United Nations' pilot program reportedly has sent vouchers to refugees using the ethereum blockchain.

在我们的区块链领域，变化的速度似乎在加快。

二零一六年我们锡帽穿戴者所希望的是区块链开始发展。比特币期货存在于我们现实中。对冲基金正在交易加密货币。全球各国政府都在推进区块链技术举措。据报道，联合国的试点方案使用以太坊区块链向难民发放了代金券。

The token sale genie is not going back into the bottle, and many predict torrents of self-described security tokens next year, particularly once a sufficient number of alternative trading systems have been launched.

代币销售的精灵不会再回到瓶子里，许多人预测明年会有大量自称为安全代币的出现，特别是当有足够数量的替代交易系统问世。

Entrepreneurs and investors, eager to devise imaginative capital-raising techniques, are exploring mini IPOs and the intersection of equity crowdfunding and token sales. Chambers and Partners released its first-ever list of blockchain and cryptocurrency lawyers globally. Legal white papers are quoted like bestsellers, and just about everyone has a view about the SAFT. It is an exciting time to be a crypto lawyer.

企业家和投资者渴望设计出富有想象力的融资技术，他们正在探索迷你ipo，以及股权众筹和代币销售的。钱伯斯和合作伙伴在全球发布了有史以来第一个全球区块链和加密货币律师名单。法律白皮书就像畅销书一样，几乎每个人都有一个关于SAFT的观点。这是一个令人兴奋的加密律师的时代。

In my view, 2018 is likely to bring with it types of technological and economic artistry that we cannot presently envision, and nearly all of those innovations will need to be understood and analyzed through a legal lens. The global blockchain and cryptocurrency community needs a strong, yet quickly adaptive, base of legal understanding on which to build and blossom. We need an informed regulatory climate that protects individuals, while encouraging technological innovation to flourish.

在我看来，2018年可能会带来一些我们目前无法预见的技术和经济艺术，几乎所有这些创新都需要通过法律视角来理解和分析。全球区块链和加密货币社区需要一个强大的、有迅速适应力的、可以建立和发展的法律基础。我们需要一个知情（有知识的）的监管环境来保护个人，同时鼓励技术创新蓬勃发展。

The future is fast, and our legal advice must be sound. In 2018, cooperative and creative thought leadership by blockchain lawyers (and non-lawyers) will be key.

未来的变化是快速的，我们的法律建议必须是合理健全的。在2018年，区块链律师(和非律师)的合作和创造性思维驱动将是关键。
