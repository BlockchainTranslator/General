I grew up the son of a personal injury lawyer in New York and have been exposed to the law my entire life. I worked in Washington, D.C. for nearly 10 years at one of the largest and fanciest law firms in the country before I started my own firm. I have even represented high-profile and high-net-worth people and companies.

我是在纽约长大的，是一名人身伤害律师的儿子，我的一生都受到法律的影响。在我创办自己的公司之前，我在华盛顿特区工作了近10年，在全国最大、最高档的律师事务所之一。我甚至代表了高知名度和高价值的人和公司。

None of this fully prepared me for my entry into the world of digital currency. It was like Keanu Reeves entering his own digital world in "The Matrix," and it happened at a South Beach bar in 2014.

这些都不足以让我进入数字货币的世界。就像基努·里维斯（Keanu Reeves）在“黑客帝国”（Matrix）中进入他自己的数字世界一样，这是在2014年在南海滩酒吧发生的。

After a few drinks, one of my friends took out his smartphone and sent me 5 BTC to impress our other friends. Much like when Neo swallowed the red pill that was offered to him, getting those bitcoin introduced me to a Wonderland in which I learn every day how much deeper the rabbit hole goes. (By the way: Thank you, unnamed friend! I have yet to move those bitcoin and have them sitting in the same wallet where you placed them almost four years ago!)

喝了几杯之后，我的一个朋友拿出了他的智能手机，给了我5个BTC，以给我们的其他朋友留下深刻印象。就像Neo吞下了他给他的红色药丸一样，这些比特币把我带到了一个仙境，我每天都在那里学习（兔子洞的深度？）。(对了，谢谢你，不知名的朋友！我还没有移动这些比特币，让它们存在你近四年前放置它们的同一个钱包里！)

But I'm also active in the industry in another way.

In the last three years, I have filed lawsuits against Cryptsy, Coinbase, Kraken, Tezos and Monkey Capital to name a few. More lawsuits are coming in the days, weeks and months ahead. Dare I say, I have filed more litigation in this space than any other lawyer in the country. I travel the country speaking at conferences, lectures and on TV.

但我也以另一种方式活跃在这个行业。

在过去的三年中，我曾经提起针对Cryptsy，Coinbase，Kraken，Tezos和Monkey Capital的诉讼。未来数日，数周甚至数月，将有更多的诉讼。我敢说，我已经在这个领域提出了比该国任何其他律师更多的诉讼。我在全国各地的会议、演讲和电视上演讲。

I have been quoted in articles published by CoinDesk, Reuters, Bloomberg and The Financial Times regarding cryptocurrency and bitcoin as an investment.

People ask me all the time: "Is bitcoin a good investment? If so, where should I buy it?"

From my unique perspective in the cryptocurrency Wonderland, I tell those people: "I have absolutely no $#@#$!% idea whether the price of bitcoin is going up or down, what alternative cryptocurrency you should buy to invest in today, or where you should buy it!"

在CoinDesk，路透社，彭博和“金融时报”发表的文章中，我曾引用过有关加密货币和比特币作为投资的文章。

人们总是问我：“比特币是不错的投资吗？如果是，我应该在哪里买？

从我在加密货币仙境中独特的角度来看，我告诉那些人：“我从来没有想到比特币的价格是涨还是跌，你今天应该买什么样的加密货币来投资，或者你可以在哪里买它！“

The next question is usually: "Seriously, what should I do?" I can only laugh and think to myself: "If I knew the answer, I would invest myself." For your information, I don't; simply because I do not know what the price of bitcoin is going to do. If I did, I would have invested in 2014 after my friend gave me those first five bitcoin.

下一个问题通常是：“认真的，我该怎么办？”我只能嘲笑自己：“如果我知道答案，我会投资自己。”而为了您的信息，我没有;只是因为我不知道比特币的价格怎么变化。如果我知道，我的朋友给了我五位比特币之后，我就会在2014年开始投资。

## The exchange lie
## 交易所撒谎

What I do know, and what I can speak about somewhat intelligently, is the universal myth that currently exists for people who are first experiencing cryptocurrencies: that all U.S.-based crypto exchanges are the same.

This myth is the single biggest threat to any investor money in this space.

我所知道的，以及我能在某种程度上说得比较机智的是，对于那些第一次经历加密货币的人来说，这是一个普遍接受的神话:所有的美国交易所都是统一的（一样的）。

这个神话是对所有投资者来说，在这一领域都是最大的威胁。

There is a difference between Bittrex, Poloniex, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini and several other lesser-known exchanges. They are not the same. The prices of your crypto on the exchanges are different, the rules and regulations they follow are different, the security is different and the quality of leadership is different.

How each exchange handles challenges and adversity is different. I'm not here to endorse any of the different exchanges, but I can tell you that each one secures customer assets, handles customer issues and provides support differently. Some are akin to legitimate banks; others are more like Bernie Madoff, with the appearance of sophistication and wealth while in reality, they are just common thieves and fraudsters.

Bittrex，Poloniex，Coinbase，Kraken，Gemini和其他一些鲜为人知的交易所之间是有区别的。他们不一样。你在交易所的加密价格是不一样的，他们遵循的规则和规定是不同的，安全是不同的，领导的质量是不同的。

每个交易所如何应对挑战和逆境是不同的。我并不是在这里支持上述这些不同的交易所，但我可以告诉您，这些交易所每一个都确保了客户资产，处理客户问题，并提供不同的支持。有些类似于合法的银行;而另一些交易所则更像伯尼麦道夫，他外表老练，富有财富，但实际上，他们只是普通的盗贼和骗子。

What happens when a flash crash occurs and clients lose money? What happens when that flash crash only occurs on one exchange but not others? What happens when that exchange happens to provide customers with margin trading like a traditional investment house but denies that those rules apply to them? What law applies and what government agencies have the power to enforce the theoretical laws that apply? When catastrophe strikes, what happens?

如果发生了闪存崩盘，客户损失了钱，会发生什么?当闪存崩盘只发生在一个交易所而不是其他交易所时，会发生什么?当交易所碰巧为客户提供像传统投资公司那样的保证金交易，但却否认这些规则适用于他们时，会发生什么?什么法律适用，什么政府机构有权力执行适用的理论法律?当这些灾难发生时，会发生什么?

Some exchanges respond to catastrophic events by refunding their customer accounts, other exchanges tell customers they're #@% out of luck.

While the latter might be good for my business – because wrongfully imposed customer losses are where lawsuits are usually born – that's not good for the consumer.

有些交易所通过退还客户损失来应对灾难性事件，而有的交易所则告诉客户他们的运气不好。

虽然后者可能对我的生意有好处 - 因为错误地强加的客户损失是诉讼通常发生的地方 - 但这对消费者并不好。


If you have ever heard me speak on this topic, you know I am a passionate believer that regulation is coming and that it's going to come hard and fast in the U.S.

如果你听说过我在这个话题上发表意见，你就会知道我是一个热情的信徒，监管即将到来，而且在美国会变得越来越快。

## Point of failure
## 失败点

That day of reckoning will collapse the weaker exchanges. Which exchanges will survive? Typically, those with the best leadership and that operate with transparency will rise to the top. As for those that fail?

那一天的清算将使较弱的交易所垮台。哪些交易所将生存呢? 通常情况下，那些拥有最好的领导能力和运作透明度的交易所将会达到顶峰。至于那些失败的交易所呢?

Good luck collecting on your losses if you had entrusted your crypto to one of those exchanges. It's expensive, time consuming and you never know how it will turn out.

如果你把你的加密货币委托给其中一个失败的交易所，那么你的损失将是巨大的，你追回损失的途径将是昂贵的，耗费时间的，你永远不知道它会变成什么。祝你好运。

As for which ICOs are viable and which ones are not, the ability to pick a winner might be a bit easier.

The answer there is: None of them have yet proven themselves to be winners; and any of them that look like winners might not in the near future once Uncle Sam and his relatives around the world wrap their hands around ICOs and crypto-related investments.

至于哪些ICOs是可行的，哪些不可行，选择赢家的能力可能会更容易一些。

答案是:他们中没有一个人能证明自己是赢家;而且，一旦山姆大叔和他的亲戚们在全球范围内围绕着ICOs和加密货币相关的投资交易时（监管），他们中的任何一个看起来像赢家的人都不会在不远的将来出现。

While I believe that more people are going to join the bitcoin and cryptocurrency parade, regulation and government intervention are going to change all the rules. I have been caught on camera advising crypto companies to get a 100 percent guarantee of free legal defense fees if their companies relied on legal advice at $1,000+/hour and that advice turns out to be flat wrong.

虽然我相信越来越多的人会加入比特币和加密货币的行列，但监管和政府干预将会改变所有的规则。我曾被拍到以100%保证免费的法律辩护费给加密货币公司提供法律建议，如果他们的公司以每小时1000美元以上的法律建议（被证明是完全错误的建议）为依据的话。

Some of my lawsuits and the lawsuits of others will demonstrate that the fallacies that some of these companies are promoting flagrantly violate of the law. There has yet to be an ICO that did not perform that was not a security.

我的一些诉讼和其他人的诉讼将会证明这些公司的一些谬论，这些错误的宣扬是违反法律的。还没有一个已经发行的ICO表明自己没有安全问题。

There, I said it. I’m sure that lost in the flood of investment opportunities is the next potential Amazon or Netflix, but for now, the safety of more traditional investments is the right choice for most people.

尽管我这么说了。但我依然相信，在投资机会的大量涌入下，公司有成为下一个亚马逊或者Netflix的潜力，但现在，更多传统投资的安全性对大多数人来说是正确的选择。

I find it odd and incredibly ironic that the self-proclaimed thought leaders on regulatory advice at the largest law firms charging the most per hour are the same lawyers telling media outlets that people should only invest in a crypto company an amount they can afford to lose.

That’s terrible legal advice and terrible investment advice.

我觉得奇怪的是，那些自称是自律建议领袖的人，即在最大的律师事务所的监管建议中每小时收费最高那些律师，他们告诉媒体，人们应该只向加密货币公司投入自己的损失承受范围之内的资金。

这是可怕的法律建议和糟糕的投资建议。

## My outlook
## 我的观点

In the crypto Wonderland, an educated consumer is the best consumer.

To be clear, just because my firm is involved in litigation against an exchange or a company that raised funds via an ICO does not mean that exchange or ICO won’t survive or isn't legitimate.

在加密货币世界中，受过教育的消费者是最好的消费者。

要清楚的是，仅仅因为我的公司参与了对通过ICO募集资金的交易所或公司的诉讼，并不意味着交易所或ICO将无法生存或不合法。

To paraphrase the fictional character Amy Gardner on the TV show "The West Wing":

"I've been crazy about [crypto] for longer than you've known [about it]. And I'll keep poking [it] with a stick. That's how I show my love."

I show my love to protect my clients who were early adopters in this space and have been blown out of it by companies who believe they are above the law. I hold companies accountable as they grow and scale, and I'll keep poking those companies with my lawsuits. That does not mean I love those companies or crypto any less. As these companies grow, scale, and legitimize in the U.S., they will learn that with responsibility comes accountability.

套用虚构人物艾米加德纳在电视节目西翼上的话说:

“我对加密货币的痴迷的时间比你所知道的要长。”我会用棍子戳它。这就是我表达我的爱的方式。”

我表达了我的爱，保护我的客户，他们是这个领域的早期采用者，并且被那些认为自己凌驾于法律之上的公司所吹捧。我认为公司的责任是随着公司规模的扩大而增加的，我要求公司承担责任，我将继续对这些公司提起诉讼。这并不意味着我更讨厌这些公司或加密货币。随着这些公司在美国的成长、壮大和合法化。他们会明白，责任就是责任，必须背负。

What you say and what you do matters. If you don't believe that, either the government or a process server with a Complaint from Silver Miller is headed your way.

你说什么，你做什么事情很重要。如果你不相信，那么无论是政府，还是一个Silver Miller投诉的服务商，都将是你的方向。

The upcoming year is going to be a wild ride for this space.

At FinTech 2017 in Washington, D.C., some people even claimed that 2018 is going to be "The Year of Crypto Litigation." They're probably right. However, if there is litigation, that means people have lost their money. That's not good for crypto consumers or crypto businesses. I hope 2018 is the year of transparency and serviceable regulation.

即将到来的一年将是这个领域的狂野之旅。

在华盛顿特区的金融科技2017年，有人甚至宣称2018年将是“加密货币诉讼年”。他们可能是对的。但是，如果有诉讼，就意味着有人失去了钱。这对加密货币消费者或加密企业来说并不好。我希望2018年是透明度和可操作性监管的一年。

A pinch here and a pinch there, not too little and certainly not too much. While many of my clients began as anarchists- and libertarians-at-heart, their focus changed when bad actors did bad things to them.

When someone steals your money and you lose that which you believe belongs to you, you seek justice.

这些都是真实世界的一个缩影，不是太小，当然也不是太多。虽然我的许多客户都是无政府主义者和自由主义者，但他们的关注点在坏企业对他们做坏事的时候改变了。

当有人偷了你的钱，你失去了你认为属于你的东西，你就要寻求正义。

In the U.S., justice requires law and order. In one of my cases, we had to get a federal court judge to order the return to my clients of 11,000+ stolen bitcoin, presently valued at over 150 million dollars. When my clients had their bitcoin stolen from them, they stopped caring so much about decentralization and autonomous and anonymous transactions.

At that point, they simply cared about their missing cryptocurrency.

在美国，正义需要法律和秩序。在我的一个案例中，我们不得不让一位联邦法院法官下令让我的客户拿回价值1.1万美元的比特币，目前价值超过1.5亿美元。当我的客户的比特币被别人从他们那里偷走的时候，他们就不再那么关心去中心化、自主和匿名的交易了。

在这个时候，他们只关心他们丢失的加密货币。

And in an ironic twist of fate, the person who helped my clients regain their faith in the non-governmentally-regulated world of cryptocurrency was... a government officer with a robe and a gavel. Maybe some government intervention into the crypto Wonderland isn't so bad after all.

在一个具有讽刺意味的案子中，帮助我的客户重新获得对非政府监管的加密货币世界的信任的人是……一个穿长袍和木槌的政府官员。也许政府对加密货币领域的干预其实并不是那么糟糕。
