Tech pioneer Brendan Eich is trying to force the adoption of a new advertising model for the internet.

技术前驱Brendan Eich正在极力推动接受一个新的互联网广告模式。

I have long considered today's internet advertising model a scam: It's a system in which giant, monopolistic companies -- Google and Facebook -- are selling inflated user numbers and overhyped targeting opportunities to advertisers while collecting way too much information about users and cheating content creators out of their fair share of revenue. It may not be too late to fix it, though. Just ask Brendan Eich, founder and chief executive officer of Brave Software, a San Francisco-based startup whose attempt to change the standards could be considered quixotic if not for Eich's track record.

我一直认为今天的互联网广告模式是一个骗局：这是一个由巨大、垄断的企业——谷歌和Facebook——所构成的系统，他们把日益增加的用户数量和大肆宣传目标的机会销售给广告商，当收集渠道过多涉及用户信息并欺诈内容创造者使他们得到不公平的收入。不过，修复这个模式可能还为时不晚。（这个问题）只要问问Brendan Eich，他是一家总部位于旧金山的初创公司（名叫Brave Software）创始人兼首席执行官。要不是出于Eich的口，你会觉得他试图改变标准的尝试可能会被认为是不切实际的。


Eich created the JavaScript programming language while working for Netscape, and then co-founded the Mozilla project, which developed the Firefox browser. He had to leave Mozilla for reasons that had nothing to do with his vision or technical prowess. His current company makes a browser, too, but it's different from others in that it prevents sites from tracking a user and blocks ads, while also bypassing the anti-ad-blocker protection used by major news sites. I've tried it and it works better than the ad-blockers in other browsers, such as Chrome and Safari. The browser is built on Google's open-source Chromium code, and its usage isn't tracked by browser market share statistics: It shows up as Chrome. "We hide in the Chrome crowd," as Eich put it to me in a conversation on the Telegram messenger. That must come in handy for a product that undermines the business model of most top websites its users visit: It's difficult to block.

Eich在为网景公司工作的时候创建了JavaScript编程语言，然后共同创建了Mozilla项目，开发了Firefox浏览器。他后来不得不离开Mozilla项目，但离开原因与他的远见和技术能力无关。他目前的公司也做了一个浏览器，但与其他公司不同的是，它阻止了网站追踪用户和屏蔽广告，同时也绕过了主要新闻网站使用的反广告拦截软件。我已经试过了，它比其他浏览器中的广告拦截器更好，比如Chrome和Safari。这款浏览器是基于谷歌的开源Chrome代码打造的，它的使用并没有被浏览器市场份额统计数据所追踪:它显示为Chrome浏览器。“我们躲在Chrome中，”Eich在电话中对我说。这对于一个破坏了其用户访问的大多数顶级网站的商业模式的产品来说是很有用的:很难阻止它。

At first glance, what Brave does should only make things worse for content creators who rely on advertising income. But Eich is looking to build a different model that should work better for them, and for advertisers, than the current one. Eich appears to think and talk faster than most people can follow:

乍一看，Brave公司的做法只会让依赖广告收入的内容创造者变得更糟。但Eich正在寻求建立一种不同的模式，对内容创造者和广告商来说，它都比目前的模式更好。Eich似乎比大多数人更快地思考和说话:

> We get direct brand and agency deals that result in a catalog, same for all users in a given region and natural language, who opt in. No tracking. Local machine learning studies multiple inputs from search and e-commerce query logs, to click logs and tab constellations, to ad views (if we have a 3rd party partnership) and actions, to e-commerce consummations, to YouTube and other big site interactions. This is the full dataset Google sees via remote tracking (and so misses where Doubleclick or another tracker they own is not embedded in remote content).

> 我们得到直接的品牌和代理协议，从而得到一个对所有同处给定地区和自然语言的用户的目录。没有跟踪。本地机器学习研究从搜索和电子商务查询日志的多个输入，到包括点击日志和标签星座、广告视图(如果我们有第三方合作伙伴)和行动、电子商务消费、YouTube和其他大型网站的交互的多个输出。这是一个完整的数据集，谷歌能通过远程跟踪看到的(因此，在Doubleclick或他们拥有的另一个跟踪器中没有嵌入到远程内容中)。

This bears explaining. Brave's idea is to take Google's (and Facebook's) place as an intermediary between advertisers and internet users by offering precise targeting based on what the browser learns about each specific user. The targeted ads would reach real humans, and not bots or multiple accounts set up by the same user, who must actually agree to see ads. In fact, Brave envisions "bank-level" know-your-client rules. As for the browsing data, Brave doesn't want to collect it and sell it on: It's supposed to remain, and be analyzed, on the user's computer.

Eich解释道。Brave公司的想法是将谷歌（和Facebook）作为广告商和互联网用户之间的媒介，通过他们的浏览器对每一位具体的用户了解提供精准的用户定位。有针对性的广告将覆盖真正需要的人群，而不是推送给同一用户建立的多个账户并且他们必须同意看到广告。事实上，Brave公司的设想是来自“银行层面”的“了解客户”规则。至于浏览器数据，Brave公司不想收集并出售，因为它们应该被用户电脑本地保留并被分析。

Why would people agree to see ads? Well, because they'd get paid for that. Starting in the first half of next year, Brave intends to hand over to users 70 percent of gross revenue from ads directly sold by the company. If publishers partner with it as an advertising conduit, the publishers will get 70 percent of revenue and users will get 15 percent. 

为什么人们会同意看广告?因为他们会为此付出代价。从明年上半年开始，Brave公司打算将公司直接销售的广告收入占到总营收的70%。如果出版商将其作为广告渠道，出版商将获得70%的收入，而用户将获得15%的收入。


That's one revenue stream for publishers. Another is supposed to come directly from browser users. Even now, Brave allows them to make voluntary payments for content from a cryptocurrency wallet attached to the browser. A user sets up a monthly catch-all subscription payment, and creators and publishers are compensated from it according to how much content the user has consumed. But one can easily imagine how a media company's own subscriptions could be integrated with the wallets, and how users could spend part of their ad revenue share for the subscriptions. 

这是出版商的一个收入来源。另一个则是直接来自浏览器用户。即使是现在，Brave公司允许用户通过浏览器上的加密数字钱包自愿付费给内容创造者。用户可以设置一个月的所有订阅，根据用户的消费内容，创作者和出版商可以从中得到补偿。但我们可以很容易地想象，媒体公司自己的订阅是如何与钱包相结合的，以及用户如何将部分广告收入用于订阅。

It's a win-win scheme for advertisers, users and publishers. Its weakness, though, is that it needs massive adoption to become interesting to them all. Eich says Brave has 1 million monthly active users, and he expects that to get to 5 million next year. As browsers go, these are tiny numbers. But, Eich says, "1 million, 5 million, all those are numbers I grew Firefox through to get to 10 million, 50 million, 100 million. I also went through Netscape going from 40 percent of market to 80 percent (and then the downhill side)."

对于广告商、用户和出版商来说，这是一个双赢的方案。不过，它的弱点在于，它需要大量让所有人都感兴趣的应用。Eich说，Brave每月有100万的活跃用户，他预计明年将达到500万。随着浏览器的发展，这些都是很小的数字。但是，Eich说，“100万，500万，所有这些数字都是我在火狐达到了1000万，5000万，1亿前经历过。”我也经历过网景公司从40%的市场份额到80%(然后是下滑的一方)。

In May, Brave held an initial coin offering, selling 1 billion so-called "basic attention tokens," its local currency that's convertible into common crypto- or fiat currencies. The tokens were sold for 156,250 ether, worth almost $67 million now, so Brave has plenty of cash on hand -- but it has also kept some of the tokens it issued to give away to users so they could pay content creators. This week, it started handing out the token grants. It's a nerdy way to stimulate adoption; but then Eich says he doesn't need a giant user base to drive standard change. He quotes Nassim Taleb's salt example: All salt sold by grocery stores is simultaneously kosher and halal, though neither Muslims not Jews make up the majority of buyers.

今年5月，Brave公司举行ICO（初次数字货币募集），出售10亿个所谓的“基础关注代币（BAT）”，这是一种可兑换为普通加密货币的本地货币。所有代币售价是156250个以太坊币，目前价值约为6700万美元，因此Brave现在手上有大量现金——但它也保留了一些赠送给用户的代币，这样用户就能支付给内容创造者。这一周，它开始发放代币。这是一种刺激接收广告刻板的方法，不过Eich说他不需要一个庞大的用户基础来推动标准的改变。他引用了Nassim Taleb的盐的例子:杂货店出售的所有盐都是犹太食品和清真食品，尽管穆斯林和犹太人并不是占多数的买家。

"Standards get moved by up-and-comers who disrupt old models," Eich told me. "Firefox did this. Mozilla has punched above its weight on standards."

“那些颠覆旧模式的人会改变标准。”Eich对我说，“这是Firefox已经做的。Mozilla已经用力在标准上推进它的影响力。”

The idea appears to be to show a better, more equitable model to the world and force the internet advertising duopoly, Google and Facebook, to take notice. There's a good reason for them to do so: Brave offers effective ad-blocking and privacy protection at a time when people are getting tired of the internet giants' use of their personal data as a freely donated commodity they can sell on. 

这一想法似乎是为了向世界展示一个更好、更公平的模式，并迫使互联网广告的双头垄断——谷歌和Facebook——注意到这一点。他们这么做有一个很好的理由:在人们厌倦了互联网巨头把他们的个人数据当作免费捐赠的商品的时候，Brave公司提供了有效的广告拦截和隐私保护。

So what does Brave want Google and Facebook to do once they realize the danger? "Buy us at right price, possibly," he replies. "I think Google might, as they would not be able to duplicate our model now without antitrust issues. They would of course consider copying rather than buying."

那么，一旦谷歌和Facebook意识到危险，Brave希望他们会做什么呢?“以合适的价格买我们，”他回答说。“我认为谷歌可能会这样做，因为在没有反垄断问题的情况下，他们将无法复制我们的模式。他们当然会考虑复制而不是购买。”

It's hard for me to buy into Eich's optimism about the duopoly's willingness completely to overhaul the way they do business, especially since Brave hasn't fully rolled out its offering yet and since scaling it depends on technological advances. It requires the company to develop further local machine learning, as well as improvements to the Ethereum platform to allow large numbers of token transactions on a blockchain. Despite its considerable cash reserves, for a startup, Brave is fighting a David-versus-Goliath battle -- and hoping, to boot, that Goliath will pay for David's skill with the sling. 

我很难相信Eich对两头垄断的乐观态度，因为他们完全改变了原有的经营公司，尤其是Brave还没完全推出他们的产品以及它的规模取决于技术的进步。它要求该公司进一步开发本地机器学习，并改进Ethereum平台，使得允许在区块链上进行大量的代币交易。尽管它有可观的现金储备，但对于一家创业公司来说，Brave公司的奋斗是和David与巨人的抗争故事类似的，并且它还希望巨人用弹弓来支付大卫的技能。

It's difficult, however, not to support the ideas behind Brave -- both as an internet user fed up with today's fraudulent advertising model and the proliferation of bots, and as a professional writer interested in selling my work. I want to see advertising only if I opt into it, and I want to get paid for looking at ads; I want to pay my favorite content creators with that revenue; I don't want to be tracked around the internet; and I think advertisers should be certain they are sending their messages to real, identified people. I hope it's not a utopia. Eich's experiment is certainly worth watching.

然而，对Brave公司背后的想法是难以拒绝的——既是因为互联网用户受够了现在虚假的广告模式和机器人的扩散，也是因为一个专业作家喜欢销售自己的作品。我想只看到自己选择观看的广告，并且我想通过看广告获得报酬；我还想为我最喜欢的内容创作者支付这一报酬；我不想在互联网一直被追踪；我想广告商应该把他们的信息发给真正有需求、被识别出来的人。我希望这不是一个乌托邦。Eich的实验当然值得关注。
