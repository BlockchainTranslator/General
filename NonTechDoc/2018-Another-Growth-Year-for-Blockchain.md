尽管没有达到预期的程度，但2017年仍然是区块链（加密货币）大幅增长的一年。

在17年初，我和其他人预测，2017年将是区块链从概念验证转入生产的一年。在这方面，我们确实看到了一些显著的成功。

Ripple成为一个全面运营的平台，拥有超过100名会员和数十亿的付款量，各行业开始形成区块链业务网络，例如贸易融资中的数字贸易链联盟（DTC）。

但总的来说，我预计会看到比这些更多的“成就”。 另一方面，我认为任何人都没有完全预料到加密货币市场资本化或相关ICO繁荣的空前增长。

那么，新的一年会带来什么？ 尽管做出预测有显著的风险，但我相信，除了这些外，我们将看到以下内容：

* 区块链解决方案将继续投入生产，因为“唾手可得的成果”得到解决。
* 传统资产管理公司和技术推动加密货币继续增长。
* 随着区块链开始转变市场结构，公司将专注于改变商业模式。
* 具有智能合约技术的新生态系统将成为现有行业之间的整合平台。
* ICO将变得“专业化”并转变为IPO 2.0。
* 区块链的可扩展性和性能将成为关键问题，并且会出现有趣的新方法。
人们会越来越认识到，当地的区块链生态系统是成功的关键因素。

现在，让我们解开细节。

## 唾手可得的成果

尽管今年比所预期的要平静，但我相信我们将继续看到区块链解决方案投入生产，因为企业通过数字化企业和使用区块链可以产生最大影响力的案例来得到“唾手可得的成果”（暗指用最少的精力就能轻易实现目标的现象）。

在金融技术方面，两个最有希望的用例仍然是支付（其中有500-600亿美元的潜在储蓄）和贸易融资（可节省约150亿美元）。

正如我们在2017年看到支付所做的那样，我预计2018年我们将看到贸易融资开始在区块链上开展活动。在支付方面，动力将增加，并且随着包括代理银行在内的大型银行开始实施，交易量将增加。这些参与者将受到区块链带来的实时处理优势，较低的风险状况，较低的成本和透明度的诱惑。

区块链既可以作为一根棍子，也可以作为一根胡萝卜，只需证明在许多行业中有更好的替代现状。例如，我们可以想象，区块链已经在欧洲银行管理局的欧盟范围透明度演习中发挥了作用。

我们都感到有些惊讶——加密电子货币在2017年如何能够作为一种投机资产的表现。事实上，增长是惊人的，按市值计算，资产类别从2016年12月的140亿美元上升到2017年12月的超过4500亿美元。

我认为这种增长将继续受到传统资产管理方法的推动，包括比特币期货，加密对冲基金等，所有这些都将增加对加密货币和代币的需求。

## 新的商业模式

随着区块链不断改变市场结构，企业将越来越关注不断变化的商业模式。

在一个中间商变得过时的世界里，企业将不得不学会独立思考，并更愿意成为生态系统或更广泛平台上的合作伙伴。这反过来又意味着决定他们想要什么样的商业模式 - 无论是平台游戏，产品游戏，全渠道策略等等。

这些讨论将会变得多元化，包括现有服务以及越来越多的区块链支持的新型服务 - 尤其是区块链与物联网和人工智能结合，以创建新的市场领域，在这些市场中，行业的silos倾向于广泛的、横向的结构。

对我来说，2017年最令人满意的部分之一是能够看到这一开始发生在我有幸与之合作的一些公司中。 （见下面的披露）

Deon Digital与奔驰合作开发新的操作系统，有助于打破移动领域的常规。 Skycell是物联网和区块链开放医药供应链以支付付款，发票和保险的好例子。 TEND正在通过为高价值资产创建共享经济2.0来重新思考投资管理。

我认为我们在2018年英国特别关注的一个领域是基金行业，像Melonport这样的公司正在使用区块链来重新考虑资产管理。我想我们会看到更多这样的情况，明年基金行业将开始大幅度洗盘。

这将从加密资产管理开始，但随着时间的推移，我们将看到传统资产越来越多地被标记化，迁移到区块链和管理链上。

## ICO的变形

随着创业公司筹集超过35亿美元的ICO，2017年显然是代币发行的一年。

然而，对我来说，ICO的繁荣意义重大，不一定是因为筹集的金额，而是因为我们看到风险投资民主化的开始。 虽然这个概念2017年有了很好的发展，但随着更多的传统参与者的加入，2018年的ICO世界将发生变化。

在接下来的12-18个月中，我预计在IPO领域拥有丰富经验和专业知识的人士将把分叉技术作为一个技术平台，整个业务将是专业化的，书籍建设，定价，启动评估等等都会沿着传统线。

正如我们已经开始看到的那样，仅仅在白皮书的背景下获得资助将会很困难。 投资者将需要合理的业务计划和高度的透明度。

## 可扩展性和生态系统

现有区块链技术的关键挑战之一是规模和性能。我预测明年我们会看到当前区块链技术的替代品，这些技术将更具可扩展性，速度更快，并将能耗降至最低。

IOTA最近获得了很大的推动力，我认为这是一个需要关注的项目。

我也相信人们会越来越多地发现，区域链区域生态系统（关键服务共同位于一个地理区域）是区块链项目的关键成功因素。

这当然是我们在瑞士的Crypto Valley看到的。作为Crypto Valley协会的会长，我希望读者能够理解我预测 - 或者至少是推动 - 瑞士作为区块链生态系统的持续成功。

Crypto Valley将区块链项目所需的所有服务集中在法律，咨询，税务，会计，智能合约平台，KYC / AML公用事业以及市场营销专业知识等方面。

再加上瑞士的其他优势，从最先进的基础设施到高技能的劳动力，在我看来，意味着这些优势在新的一年和未来的许多年里，它仍将是区块链公司的一大吸引力。

-----------------------------------------------

2017 was a year of tremendous growth for blockchain, though not in the expected ways.

At the beginning of this year, I and others predicted that 2017 would be the year that blockchain moved from proof-of-concepts into production. We did see some notable successes in this regard.

Ripple became a fully operational platform with over 100 members and payment volumes in the billions, and industries began to form blockchain business networks, for example, the Digital Trade Chain consortium (DTC) in trade finance.

But overall, I expected to see more "go lives" than we did. On the other hand, I don't think anyone expected the unprecedented growth in the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies or the related ICO boom.

So, what will the new year bring? Despite the obvious perils in making predictions, I feel confident that, among other things, we will see the following:

Blockchain solutions will continue to come into production as the "low-hanging fruit" are addressed.
Cryptocurrencies will continue to grow, fueled by traditional asset management players and techniques.
Companies will focus on changing business models as blockchain begins to transform market structures.
New ecosystems with smart contract technology will arise as integration platforms between existing industries.
The ICO will become "professionalized" and morph into IPO 2.0.
Scalability and performance of blockchains will become a critical issue, and there will be interesting new approaches
People will increasingly recognize that local blockchain ecosystems are a critical success factor.
Now, let's unpack the details.

Low-hanging fruit
Although it was quieter than expected this year, I believe we will continue to see blockchain solutions come into production as enterprises address the "low-hanging fruit" by digitizing businesses and use cases where blockchain can make the most impact.

In fintech, the two most promising use cases remain payments (where there are $50-60 billion of potential savings to be had) and trade finance (which stands to save some $15 billion).

As we saw payments do in 2017, I expect we will see trade finance begin to go live on blockchain in 2018. In payments, momentum will pick up and volumes will increase as larger banks, including correspondent banks, get into the act. These players will be tempted by the advantages blockchain brings in terms of real-time processing, lower risk profiles, lower costs and transparency.

Blockchain can serve as a stick as well as a carrot, simply by proving that there are better alternatives to the status quo in many industries. We can imagine, as an example, that blockchain has had a hand to play in the European Banking Authority's EU-wide transparency exercises.

We were all somewhat surprised - if pleasantly so - by how well cryptocurrencies did in 2017 as a speculative asset. Indeed, growth was spectacular, with the asset class rising from $14 billion in December 2016 to over $450 billion in December 2017 in terms of market capitalization.

I think this growth will continue to be fueled by traditional asset management approaches, including bitcoin futures, crypto hedge funds and the like, all of which will increase the demand for cryptocurrencies and tokens.

New business models
As blockchain continues to change market structures, companies will increasingly focus on changing business models.

In a world where middlemen are becoming obsolete, companies will have to learn to stop thinking in silos and be more open to becoming partners in ecosystems or on broader platforms. That, in turn, means deciding what kinds of business models they want - whether it's platform plays, product plays, omni-channel strategies, and so on.

These discussions will become multi-dimensional, encompassing both existing services and, increasingly, the new kinds of services that blockchain enables - particularly as blockchain combines with IoT and AI to create new kinds of marketplaces where industry silos come down in favor of broad, horizontal structures.

One of the most satisfying parts of 2017 for me was being able to see this start to happen close-hand among some of the companies I have the privilege to work with. (See disclosures below.)

Deon Digital has partnered with Mercedes Benz to develop a new operating system that will help break down silos in the mobility space. Skycell is a good example of IoT and blockchain opening up the pharmaceutical supply chain to embrace payments, invoicing and insurance. TEND is rethinking investment management by creating a Sharing Economy 2.0 for high-value assets.

One space I think we should keep a particular eye on in 2018 is the fund industry, where firms like Melonport are using blockchain to rethink asset management. I think we will see more of this, and that the fund industry will start to be significantly disrupted next year.

This will start with the management of crypto assets, but over time we will see traditional assets increasingly being tokenized, migrated onto blockchains and managed on-chain.

The morphing of ICOs
With startups raising over $3.5 billion in ICOs, 2017 was clearly the year of the token launch.

To me, though, the ICO boom is significant, not necessarily because of the amounts raised, but because we are seeing the beginnings of the democratization of venture capital. And though the concept had a great 2017, change will come to the world of ICOs in 2018 as more traditional players get involved.

Over the next 12-18 months, I expect people with experience and expertise in the IPO world will embrace tokenization as a technical platform, and the whole business will be professionalized, with book building, pricing, startup evaluation and so on happening more along traditional lines.

As we've already begun to see, it will be harder to get funding simply on the back of a white paper. Investors will demand sound business plans and high levels of transparency, with all that entails.

Scalability and ecosystems
One of the key challenges of existing blockchain technology is scale and performance. I predict that next year we will see alternatives to current blockchain technologies that will be more scalable, faster and minimize energy consumption.

IOTA, which has gained a lot of traction lately, is, I think, a project to watch in this regard.

I also believe people will increasingly find that local blockchain ecosystems, where critical services are co-located in one geographical area, are critical success factors for blockchain projects.

This is certainly what we see in the "Crypto Valley" in Switzerland. As the President of the Crypto Valley Association, I hope readers will forgive me for predicting - or at the least, pitching for - the continued success of Switzerland as a blockchain ecosystem.

Crypto Valley has a high concentration of all the services blockchain projects will need to raise money and set up shop, including legal, advisory, tax, accounting, smart contract platforms, KYC/AML utilities and marketing expertise.

This coupled with Switzerland's other advantages, from its state-of-the-art infrastructure to its highly skilled workforce, will, in my opinion, mean it should remain a great draw for blockchain companies - in the new year and hopefully for many years to come.
