Blockchains need a constitution. After 8 years and hundreds of blockchain experiments, one thing is perfectly clear: blockchains do not solve the governance problem. The theory that code is law and the argument that objective math is an incorruptible ruler have both failed in practice.

区块链需要一部宪法。时长8年，经过上百次的区块链试验，有一件事情十分清晰：区块链解决不了管理问题。代码就是法律这一理论，以及数学的客观性保证规则不会被破坏的这一论述，在实践中都失败了。

### People are the Blockchain 人就是区块链

It is the people who use a blockchain as an accounting system that give numbers derived from the blockchain value. Any and all value held by Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Steem exists solely at the whim of public opinion.

正是那些使用区块链作为记账系统的人提供了源自于区块链价值的数字。Bitcoin, Ethereum 或者 Steem 承载的任意一个以及所有的价值只存在于公众的突发奇想。

Governance in Bitcoin is mired in gridlock for lack of a formal process. Something as simple as changing the block size has led to unending debate, denial of service, censorship, and other underhanded tactics. If any system were to let the code rule it would be a system that makes effective coordination and cooperation impossible.

因为缺乏一个正规的过程，对比特币的管理陷入了僵局。如改变区块大小这样简单的事情已经导致无休止的争论，拒绝服务，审查以及其他偷偷摸摸的把戏。如果任意一个系统让代码来决定一切，那么这个系统将会让有效的协调和配合变得不可能。

Most people recognize that a rigid set of code is a cruel master. If code is to rule, then code must be immutable. If code is immutable then it lacks the ability to adapt which will eventually lead to extinction in the darwinian marketplace.

大多数人认为，代码的严谨性体现出不可修改的特点。如果代码是为了进行管理，那么它必须是不可篡改的。如果代码是不能修改的，那么它就缺乏适应的能力；从进化论层面来说，这将最终导致不复存在。

What is worse, immutable code assumes perfect (bug free) code. Any serious programmer knows an nontrivial code is impossible to perfect or guarantee to be bug free. Developers are still finding exploits in security critical code that is decades old and has been reviewed by thousands of open source users.

糟糕的是，不能修改的代码表现出来的就是它是完美的（没有错误）。任何严谨的程序员都知道，一段重要的代码是不可能完美的或者保证是没有错误的。开发人员仍旧在查找安全关键代码中的神来之笔，这些代码是几十年前写的，一直被上千名开源软件的用户仔细研究。

If code is to be tamed by people, then governance becomes essential. The code can help implement the governance process, but ultimately it is the people who must cooperate with one another to effect change. We cannot even rely on the code to perfectly implement governance.

如果代码接受修改， 那么管理方法就变得十分必要。代码能够帮助执行管理过程，但是，最终是人必须与其他人合作才能产生有效的改变。我们不能只依赖代码来完美地解决管理问题。

### Majority Rules is not Enough 多数统治原则还不够

Systems like BitShares, Steem, and The DAO operate on the premise of one-share, one-vote. The model is very similar to a corporation where the shareholders vote to select directors who operate the company.

BitShares、Steem 和 DAO 这样的系统都运行于一人一票的前提下。这个模型很类似于一家公司；股东投票选出这家公司的董事。

Under a majority rules system there is no guarantee that 51% will not abuse the 49% or that the 99% will not abuse the 1%. Majority rules is a variation of might-makes-right and cannot protect property rights or any other community values.

在一个多数统治原则的系统内，不能保证51%的人不会不公正地对待另外的49%，或者99%的人会公平地看待其余的1%。多数统治原则是“也许这件事能成”的变体，并不能保护财产权或者任何其它的社区价值。

### Governance by Constitution 通过宪法来治理

I have been a critic of the United States Constitution because it either authorizes the tyrannical police state we have today, or it is powerless to stop it. Either way, the Constitution of These United States has failed.

我对美国宪法一直是持批评态度的，因为它要么给残暴的极权国家体系赋予权利，要么它无力去阻止这一切。不管是哪一种，美国的宪法并没有很好地发挥它的作用。

> Constitution a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed.
>
> 宪法：一套基本原则或者已有的先例，在它的框架内，一个国家或者组织被公认为要按照它来管理。

In my opinion, the U.S. constitution has failed for the following reasons:

我认为，美国宪法没能发挥作用有以下原因：

1. It authorized the use of force for taxation 它授予了征税的权力
2. Laws are interpreted by human judges 法律由人作出判断来解释。
3. It makes it too easy to change laws 它使得修改法律非常容易。
4. Geographic monopoly prevents competition 地域垄断阻碍竞争。

A blockchain based system can remedy all of these things.

一个以区块链为基础的系统能够修复这一切。

#### Blockchains are Nonviolent 区块链是非暴力的

A blockchain is inherently non-violent. A blockchain is sovereign over its own data and changing numbers in the database is never a violent act. If these numbers have meaning/value to people, that meaning and value resides in the subjective opinion of each individual. A blockchain law that taxes your account is not violent, it is merely an expression of public opinion on your purchasing power.

区块链天生就是非暴力的。区块链对它的数据拥有最高权利，改变数据库里的数字从来不是暴力行为。如果这些数字对人们有意义或有价值，那么这种意义和价值驻留在每个人的主观看法里。一个对你账户收税的区块链法律并不是暴力的，它只是一种对你购买力的公开表达方式。

#### Blockchains are Interpreted by Computers 区块链由计算机解释

The law of the blockchain is written in code. Code is unambiguous and reliably evaluated by every individual who cares to evaluate it. There is no possibility of disagreement on the deterministic judgements rendered by the computer. This level of clarity and formality protects everyone and prevents judges from exercising arbitrary power through biased interpretations.

区块链的法律写在代码里。代码是没有歧义的，每个关心它的质量如何的人可靠地对它作出评估。计算机提交的确定性的判断不太可能出现分歧。这种清晰性和条理性保护着每个人，阻止来自于通过偏见解释而施加的随性的判断。

#### Blockchain Laws can be Difficult to Change 区块链法律可能很难改变

Bitcoin is a perfect example of how lack-of-governance makes laws difficult to change. It is trivial to implement a formal process that makes changing of laws just as difficult (or more so) than changing Bitcoin.

比特币完美地示范了一个缺少管理而使得法律很难改变的系统。通过一个规范的过程来让改变法律像改变比特币一样难是没有意义的。

If you require 100% unanimous agreement to change the code, then your system will be just as hard to change as Bitcoin. Eventually market forces will determine the fate. The blockchain will fork and the market will decide which fork has value and which one is worthless. The market might even give both sides different non-zero values.

如果你们要求100%的完全同意修改这个代码，那么你们的系统将会像比特币一样很难改变。最终，市场力量将决定命运。区块链将分叉，市场将决定哪一个有价值，哪一个没有价值。市场可能甚至给这两个叉不同非零的价值。

#### The goal is to avoid Forks 目标是避免分叉

The purpose of any governance system is to minimize the likelihood of a fork. A fork occurs anytime an organization is divided into two or more parts that each go their separate way. Usually both sides of a fork lose as the sum of the forks is less than the value of the whole.

任何一个管理系统的目的是让分叉的可能性最小化。每当一个组织被分成两个或多个 ，每一个都走上自己的发展道路时，分叉就出现了。通常，当这些分叉的总价值低于整体的价值时候，这两个分出的叉都是失败的。

A constitution combined with on-blockchain governance exists to avoid forks. This is achieved through the following processes.

一部结合区块链管理的宪法能够避免分叉。这通过以下过程实现。

1. the community self-selects people with common values社区自我选择那些有共同价值观的人
2. the community has a means to measure validity of proposed laws社区有手段来评估法案的有效性。

Failure to define a constitution will result in everyone developing their own opinion on what the community values should be. Eventually something will happen that will result in an unresolvable conflict of values. When this happens the community will split and everyone will be poorer for it.

没有明确宪法将导致每个人对“社区的价值应该是什么”形成自己的观点。最终，发生的事情就是将导致不可调和的价值冲突。当出现这种情况时，社区将分裂，每个人的处境将为此变得更糟。

### Qualities of a Good Constitution 好宪法的特点

A good constitution sets the boundaries of acceptable law / code. It must be narrow enough to have meaning, but not so narrow as to over restrict development of code.

好宪法设定可接受的法律/代码的边界。它必须足够有限，用于包含该有的意义，但是又不能过于局限以至于过分限制代码的开发。

#### Define Values not Laws 定义价值观而不是法律

> Values - a person's principles or standards of behavior; one's judgment of what is important in life.
>
> 价值观：一个人的行事原则或者标准；一个人对生活中什么是重要的作出的判断

Given the same set of facts, rational people draw different conclusions due to different values. Two people that have the same values can have a productive debate that reaches a conclusion they both agree with. People with different values often have unresolvable differences of opinion. By defining values a community self-selects for people that are likely able to reach consensus.

根据相同的事实，由于不同的价值观理性的人得出不同的结论。两个有同样价值观的人能够进行一场有效的争论，达成他们一致同意的结论。具有不同价值观的人经常产生意见不统一的观点分歧。通过定义价值观，一个社区自我选择那些可能能够达成共识的人。

Defining laws does not work because they are overly specific. Two people with different values can agree on the same law for different reasons. If people come together because of agreement on the current set of laws, there is no guarantee that they are likely to agree to any changes to the law.

制定法律并不会有用，因为它们过于具体。两个拥有不同价值观的人能够出于不同的原因认同相同的法律。如果人们因为认同当前的法律走到一起，并不能保证他们可能同意对法律作出修改。

#### Define the Minimal set of Values 定义价值观的最小集

We don’t need to agree on religion to do business. The more values a community defines in its constitution, the less likely the community is to grow. Broad, universally accepted values are more likely to be successful than narrow / controversial values.

我们不必要对宗教达成共识才能做事。一个社区在它的宪法中定义的价值观越多，这个社区就不太可能成长。广泛的、普世的价值观更可能比狭隘或者有争议的价值观获得成功。

#### Don’t assume the Impossible 不要假设不可能的事情

If you declare the value that code is law in your constitution then you assume code is bug free and that code reflects intent. This is a set of values that are clearly based upon flawed premises. Even Bitcoin forks to fix bugs.

如果在宪法中你宣称代码就是法律的价值观，那么你就假定代码是没有漏洞的以及代码反映了社区的意图。这样的价值观明显基于有缺陷的前提。甚至比特币都要分叉来修复漏洞。

#### Make Constitution Immutable 让宪法不可更改

If a blockchain is to have flexible laws (code), then it needs a practically immutable constitution. If there is a need to change the constitution, then chances are it is defining laws rather than values. Community values should not change over time because not everyone will change their values at once. If values change then forks are inevitable.

如果区块链拥有易变通的法律（代码），那么它需要一套实际上不可以修改的宪法。如果有修改这个宪法的需求，那么可能的情况是它定义的是法律而不是价值观。社区价值观不应该随着时间而改变，因为不是每个人会马上就改变自己的价值观。如果价值观发生变化，那么分叉就不可避免。

In the event that new values are required, then a new community should form and the market will assign value to each community. If an issue isn’t big enough to form a new community over, then it isn’t big enough to justify a change to the constitution.

如果需要新的价值观，那么一个新的社区应该因此而形成，并且市场将对每个社区赋予价值。如果一个问题对形成一个新社区而言还不够重要，那么它就不足以重大到能够证实要对宪法作出修改。

#### Provide for Dispute Resolution and Jurisdiction 为解决纠纷和司法权做好准备

In the absence of an agreed jurisdiction, conflicts between community members are subject to any and all jurisdictions. Ultimately a blockchain is nothing more than an unincorporated cooperative, partnership, community, organization, or company operating outside any jurisdiction. People come together, define a governance structure, and adopt a blockchain as an accounting system.

在缺乏一种被认同的司法权情况下，社区成员之间的冲突容易受到任意一种以及所有的司法权的影响。最终，区块链与脱离任何司法权运行的非结团的企业、合伙人、社区、组织或者公司相差无几。人们走到一起，定义一套管理结构 ，采用区块链作为一个记账系统。

There will be disputes that go beyond the blockchain. By planning in advance, everyone in the community is better off.

将会有不少超出区块链的争论。通过提前计划，社区里的每个人都会变得更好。

I recommend using arbitration and an immutable set of international law. Specifying any countries law is likely to result in laws that change in ways that violate community values.

我推荐使用仲裁和一套不可更改的国际法。指定任一个国家的法律可能导致的结果就是：这些法律带来的变化就是违背社区价值观。

#### Get Signed Acceptance 签名表示接受

Every user should cryptographically sign the constitution. This gives the dispute resolution terms standing in a court of law and demonstrates the extent to which the community has consented to a common set of values. Failure to agree on values should be a red-flag.

每个用户都应该对这个宪法数字签名。这提供了法庭上使用的争论解决术语，证实了社区对一套普适的价值观认同的程度。不能认同这些价值观应该是个危险信号。

### Conclusion 结论

A properly written constitution that is universally accepted by almost all members of a crypto-currency community is a critical component toward building confidence in the market. It is best to define your constitution early, before problems come up. If you wait until problems show up, then it will only make the problems more difficult.

一套被加密货币社区几乎所有成员普遍接受的宪法，是树立对这一市场的信心的至关重要的部分。最好在问题出现之前早点制定你们的宪法。如果你一直等到问题出现，那么这只会使问题更加棘手。
