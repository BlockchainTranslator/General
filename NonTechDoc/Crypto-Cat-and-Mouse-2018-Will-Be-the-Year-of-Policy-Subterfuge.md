The new year will usher in regulatory arbitrage amongst companies that want to develop innovative solutions, as well as from states seeking to maximize tax receipts from cryptocurrency-related businesses.

While this may sound like a bold statement given what we saw in 2017, I believe the controversy brought by state approaches to cryptocurrency regulation this year far will exceed that of last year. In the regulatory world of financial services, the divergence of attitudes between state regulators is striking, ranging from the official recognition of bitcoin as a payment form in Japan to a shadow ban in China.

在新的一年里，那些想要开发创新解决方案的公司，以及那些寻求从加密货币相关业务中获得税收收入的国家，都将迎来监管套利。

尽管这听起来像是我们在2017年看到的一个大胆的声明，但我相信，今年国家对加密货币监管的争议将远远超过去年。在金融服务监管领域，各国监管机构之间的态度分歧令人瞩目，如日本官方承认的比特币是一种新的支付形式，而中国的却颁布了禁令。

At the same time, a number of countries have decided to keep their powder dry whilst they explore how the industry unfolds prior to spelling out their thinking on the technologies.

Looking ahead, I believe it's worth keeping in mind the diversity of approaches.

与此同时，一些国家已经决定先不干预加密货币的发展，同时探索如何在技术上阐明它们的想法。

展望未来，我认为值得关注的是各种政策方法的多样性。

## UK: Positioning for maximum market share
## 英国:最大市场份额的定位

The UK has decided to play a clever game so far.

It appears to want to keep its reputation as an easy place to do business in tact whilst it seeks to understand the best way to move forward. This may be in part due to the spectre of a full blown banking meltdown if banks fall too far behind in the constructive destruction that accompanies the natural order of innovation.

到目前为止，英国已经决定玩一个聪明的游戏。

它似乎想要保持自己的声誉，作为一个容易做生意的好地方，同时它也试图了解前进的最佳方式。这在一定程度上是由于，如果银行在与自然创新的自然秩序相伴随的建设性破坏中落在了后面，那么银行业将彻底崩溃。

Traditional banks have seen the writing on the wall, too. Take, for example, the ill-informed vitriol emanating from the likes of JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon who calls bitcoin a scam whilst also being a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and forming a partnership with Zcash.

Not all bankers are cut from the same cloth, however. There is no better marketeer for the campaign to bring change within the banking sector than former Barclays CEO, Anthony Jenkins. He revealed his view during a CNBC interview that banks stand to experience their very own "Kodak moment" should they refuse to keep up with the progress that fintech represents.

传统银行也看到了这方面的信息。例如，从摩根大通的杰米戴蒙这样的人那里，他说，比特币是一种骗局，但于此同时，他又是企业以太联盟的创始成员，并与Zcash建立了合作关系。

然而，并不是所有的银行家都持有同样的观点。没有比前巴克莱银行首席执行官安东尼詹金斯更能推动银行业变革的人了。他在接受CNBC采访时透露了自己的观点，即如果银行拒绝跟上金融科技所代表的进步，银行将会经历他们自己的“柯达时刻”。

To what extent bankers listen to Jenkins’ warning that “...we can imagine total transformation of the banking system, using blockchain for example, in a world where banks don't really exist anymore," remains to be seen. Jenkins was seen a classy operator in the UK banking sector and his views will have informed the UK government's positioning on the matter.

In the UK, an official announcement was made by the regulator to "warn investors of risks" associated with bitcoin, whilst simultaneously veering sharply away from any rules to inhibit commerce. Such an approach suggests savvy thinking from a government that understands the need for high-growth companies to take up the slack in a post-Brexit environment.

银行家们在多大程度上听着詹金斯的警告:“……我们可以想象，在一个银行不再真正存在的世界里，银行系统的彻底转型”还有待观察。詹金斯被视为英国银行业的一名优秀的经营者，他的观点也将暗示英国政府在这件事上的立场。

在英国，监管机构发布了一项官方声明，旨在“警告投资者与比特币相关的风险”，同时严厉禁止任何限制商业行为的规定。这种方法表明了政府的理性思维，这个政府理解高增长公司需要在英国脱欧后的环境中摆脱困境。

According to recent data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UK financial sector represents around 7 percent of GDP but accounts for 10 percent of tax revenues and 14 percent of exports. Any draconian crack down on cryptocurrencies could be taken as a red flag by global investors responsible for the UK’s soaring FDI, which grew to $253.7 billion (197 billion pounds) in 2016, up from £33 billion the previous year, according to OECD data.

根据国际货币基金组织(IMF)最近的数据，英国金融业占GDP的比重约为7%，但占税收收入的10%，出口占14%。经合组织的数据显示，对加密货币的任何严厉打击都可能被全球投资者视为一种危险信号，因为这些投资者对英国的外资产生了严重的影响。这些国家的外资在2016年增长到了2537亿美元(197亿英镑)，高于上一年的330亿美元。

## China: Hiding away from financial freedoms

China, on the other hand, has gone for the "head in sand" option, placing a covert ban on exchanges and massively shooting itself in the foot. China's citizens make up some of the most technologically able people in the world. Everyday Chinese people demonstrate on a daily basis how globalization and peoples’ need to control over their own financial futures act as a cosmopolitan impulse shared by the whole of humanity.

而另一方面，中国则做出了另一种选择，对交易所进行了秘密的禁令，并大规模地组织了自己的脚步。中国的公民构成了世界上最具技术水平的人。中国人民每天都在展示：全球化和人民控制自己的金融期货行为是全人类共有的一种世界性的冲动。

Whilst the country’s political class comes to terms with unstoppable changes, its citizens find ingenious ways to circumvent prohibitions and the state loses its chance to share in the spoils of progress.

China can bury its head in the sand for now but the tremendous losses it is stacking up in terms of opportunity costs will come home to roost in a relatively short period of time.

当这个国家的政治阶层面对不可阻挡的变化时，其公民找到了巧妙的规避禁令的方法，而国家也失去了分享进步成果的机会。

中国在机会成本方面的巨大损失将会在相对较短时间内得到体现。

There is a good deal of complexity in how most other states communicate their intentions towards cryptocurrencies.

And, this reinforces a zero-sum game model as far as the cryptocurrency focussed businesses are concerned. Just as traditional banks move headquarters to jurisdictions with favorable regulatory regimes, so too will cryptocurrency related companies move to light touch or ‘wait and see’ countries.

大多数其他国家所表达出的他们对加密货币的态度，存在着相当大的复杂性。

而且，这也强化了一种零和游戏模式，就像加密货币业务所关注的那样。正如传统银行将总部迁至拥有良好监管机制的司法辖区一样，加密货币相关公司也会转向“轻微干预”或“观望”的国家。

## Germany: A precise approach to cryptocurrencies
## 德国:加密货币的精确方法（政策，态度）

Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, for example, views cryptocurrencies as financial instruments. However, their use as cash or deposits does not require authorisation from the regulator.

例如，德国联邦金融监管局将密码货币视为金融工具。然而，它们作为现金或存款的用途并不需要监管机构的批准。

Importantly, it has ruled that service providers may take payments in cryptocurrencies without being seen as carrying out banking or financial services. Where transactions “are similar enough” to broking services, then regulations may apply.

重要的是，它已经裁定，服务提供商可以使用加密货币的方式进行支付，而不被视为进行银行或金融服务。如果交易“足够相似”到经纪服务，那么规则可能适用。

One example of this is when a mining pool, for example, makes a distribution of proceeds or provides services that the German regulator believes constitute a market. Authorisation may be applied in such cases.

举个例子，例如，当一个采矿池将收益分配或提供服务时，德国监管机构认为这些服务构成了一个市场。在这种情况下，可以申请授权。

## Singapore: A case-by-case study
## 新加坡：个案研究（具体问题具体对待）

In Singapore, the FCA, like the UK’s FCA, sent a warning note out to consumers about what is saw as potential risks relating to both ICOs and cryptocurrencies. The regulator said that some but not all ICOs will fall outside its scope for regulation, meaning it wants to look at individual cases and think how it should respond.

在新加坡，FCA，就像英国的FCA一样，向消费者发出了一份警告，告诉他们哪些是ICOs和加密货币的潜在风险。该监管机构表示，部分但并非所有的ICOs都将超出监管范围，这意味着它将关注个别案例，并思考该如何应对。

This isn’t a terrible strategy for cryptocurrency companies because it means there is room for creative thinking about how to navigate specific countries’ needs.

对于加密货币公司来说，这不是一个可怕的策略，因为这意味着可以在特定国家的需求（规定）中进行创造性思考。

The Singaporean FCA points to factors that might mean regulations would apply. Such cases may include those where there is a good deal of similarity between the ICO and an IPO, or if the ICO looked very much like a shares placement as conducted by private companies. And, if the ICO appears to be similar to one of its regulated activities, then it’s rules would come into effect.

新加坡FCA指出了一些法规可能适用的案例。这样的案例可能包括那些在ICO和IPO之间有很多相似之处的情况，或者如果ICO看起来非常像私人公司所做的股票配售。而且，如果ICO看起来和其中一项受监管活动相似，那么监管规则就会生效。

## Policy divergences bring opportunity
## 政策差异带来的机会

Yet, all the approaches aside, blockchain technologies will most certainly continue to prosper in an environment where there is no one coordinated global policy to undermine its progress. Indeed, tremendous opportunities lie ahead for entrepreneurs willing to arbitrage out of countries which restrict development to more favorable regulatory environments.

然而，即使有了上述政策，区块链技术在没有一个协调的全球政策来破坏其进展的环境中，肯定会继续繁荣下去。实际上，那些愿意从那些将发展限制在更有利的监管环境的国家中获利的企业家，将面临巨大的机遇。

And, politicians will be keenly aware that an overzealous regime will undermine their efforts to encourage investment while doing little to provide citizens with a competitive market.

而且，政客们会敏锐地意识到，一个过于热心（监管严厉）的政权会削弱他们鼓励投资方面的努力，而在为公民提供一个有竞争力的市场方面做得很少。

Divergence on regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies may appear to some as simply a matter of differing stages of policy development by national regulators. Such a view entirely misses the enormous efforts currently being undertaken by most Western European states at least to vigorously market their high growth industries around the world.

与加密货币有关的法规的分歧可能仅仅是国家监管机构政策制定的不同阶段的问题。这种观点完全忽略了大多数西欧国家目前正在进行的巨大努力，至少要大力推销他们在世界各地的高增长产业。

At the beginning of 2017, Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen appointed an Ambassador to the global technology industry as part of the nation’s “techplomacy” initiative. In the UK, the Department of International Trade’s Venture Capital Unit helped UK companies raise over £750 million in international venture capital over the last three years and is highly visible at global FInTech events around the world.

在2017年初，丹麦外交部长Anders Samuelsen任命了一名驻全球科技行业大使，这是美国“技术计划”的一部分。在英国，国际贸易风险投资部门帮助英国企业在过去三年里筹集了超过7.5亿英镑的国际风险资本，并且在全球金融科技活动中非常引人注目。

Indeed, in December of 2017, the FCA issued feedback on its discussion paper on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which it introduced earlier in the year. Cleverly, the paper was positioned as "not being about bitcoin" but rather about DLT’s in the general sense.

事实上，在2017年12月，FCA在其关于分布式账本技术(DLT)的讨论报告上发布了反馈意见，该报告是在今年早些时候引入的。聪明的是，这篇论文被定位为“不是关于比特币”，而是关于DLT的总体意义。

Any advances made in the field of DLT policy development cannot simply dismiss cryptocurrencies as something external to the debate. The political ‘optics’ at this stage, however, demands such a separation.

2018 will deepen the divide between countries’ different approaches as they simultaneously manoeuvre to capitalise in the long term on these high growth companies.

在DLT政策开发领域取得的任何进展，都不能简单地将加密货币作为辩论之外的因素。然而，这个阶段的政治要求这样的分离。

2018年将加深不同国家不同方法之间的分歧，因为它们同时都在利用这些高增长公司的长期利益。

Reticence by certain countries to make the most of cryptocurrencies so far may yet bring the sound of screeching hand-brakes as policy U-turns ring out of government departments.

到目前为止，一些国家为了充分利用加密货币，在使用加密货币时保持缄默的态度，但后续很可能还会带来刺耳的刹车声（禁令），因为政府部门的政策可能会出现转变。
