I was recently interviewed by FHM Magazine about, surprise surprise, Bitcoin, Blockchains, and cryptocurrencies. We were halfway through the discussion when I was asked a question about the proliferation of Bitcoin investment scams and get-rich-quick schemes, and how it affects the industry.

最近接受FHM杂志的采访，被问到了关于比特币、区块链以及加密货币的事情。聊到一半时，采访者问了我一个问题，关于比特币投资诈骗和暴富骗局扩散的问题，以及这些事情会对行业有什么影响。

Right when I was about to give my usual answer of how these schemes are evil, how we should educate people about the perils of joining them, etc. etc., I had a sudden epiphany and surprised myself by answering — “The ponzi schemes themselves are not the real problem.”

当我准备给出我通常的答案，回答说这些骗局有多么邪恶，我们应该教育人们知道加入他们的危险，等等，我突然冒出来了一个念头，我的回答让自己都觉得惊讶: “庞氏骗局本身并不是真正的问题。”

## The Root Cause of Get-Rich-Quick Schemes 暴富骗局的根本缘由

You see, these get-rich-quick schemes are not the problem, but are the symptoms of a deeper and bigger problem — the real problem is that most people have practically zero investment opportunities in today’s world of finance as we know it.

你看，这些声称让人暴富的骗局并不是真正的问题，而是一个更深层更大的问题的症状 ---真正的问题是，在我们所知的当今金融世界里，大多数人几乎没有投资机会。

This is absolutely true for countries like the Philippines, and also for most developing countries of the world. People with incomes that are enough to get by but still manage to eke out small savings are punished by inflation and rising prices of goods and services. They are frustrated, and they look at anything that can offer a way out of the rat race. I would argue that people who join ponzi schemes are quite aware of the the risks, and some even willingly participate knowing it is a scam, with the hope that they can earn a little more money before they exit at the expense of a greater, more desperate fool. It’s sad, but it is true.

对于像菲律宾这样的国家和世界上大多数发展中国家来说，这是绝对正确的。有收入的人可以勉强度日，能勉强维持一小部分储蓄，但是他们却受到通货膨胀和商品和服务价格上涨的惩罚。他们很沮丧，寻找任何能提供出路的方式。我认为，参与庞氏骗局的人非常清楚这些风险，有些人甚至心甘情愿地参与其中，因为他们知道这是一种骗局，希望他们能赚到更多的钱，然后以牺牲一个更笨、更绝望的傻瓜为代价退出来。这很可悲，但却是事实。

These people are craving for opportunities and have worked hard to have a modest amount of capital. Problems is, most don’t qualify for a bank loan to start a business.They’re ignored by every financial advisor, every stock broker, every mutual fund manager, because they “only” have $250 or so to spare. The chance that they will be able to participate in a futures market or stock exchange is practically zero. Instead, they are forced to try their only other legal alternatives — gambling their money in casinos and lotteries, or worse, joining illegal schemes out of sheer desperation.

这些人渴望获得机会，并且努力工作以获得适度的资本。问题是，大多数人没有资格申请银行贷款来创业。他们被每个理财顾问、股票经纪人、共同基金经理忽视，因为他们“只”有250美元左右。他们能够参与期货市场或股票交易所的可能性几乎为零。相反，他们被迫尝试他们唯一的其他合法选择——在赌场和彩票中赌博，或者更糟的是，在极度的绝望中加入非法的骗局。

![schemes-2.jpeg](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1084915-986e55d5a67b0927.jpeg?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

Have you seen the lines outside the lottery booths found on every street corner? How ironic is it that most governments warn their citizens about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, yet legalize lotteries and earn millions from it? They allow casinos to operate left and right, knowing full well that lives will be ruined and people will lose their shirts. These are guaranteed losses for the individual, guaranteed odds stacked against them, but hey, it’s nice and bright and shiny, and they give free iced tea and air conditioning, so why not?

你有没有看到每个街角的彩票摊位外面的长队？讽刺的是，几乎所有的政府都会警告居民投资比特币等加密货币的风险，它们却让彩票合法，从中获利上百万？他们允许赌场左右开办，完全知道生活会被摧毁，人们会输得连衬衫都不剩。这对于个人而言，是注定的失败，但是，嘿， 阳光明媚，他们提供免费的冰冻茶饮，和空调，为什么不去呢？

In America, half of US adults play the lottery. That means in any given household, at least one parent probably bets on the lotto. Here at home in the Philippines, it is estimated that three million Filipinos bet regularly on the lottery, but if you count the illegal gambling schemes like “jueteng” or cockfighting, that number could quadruple. But let’s focus on the official lottery — an average person betting a dollar per day will spend about $365 in a year, a statistically guaranteed net loss. Repeat this for three million people with a fool’s hope of hitting the jackpot, and that’s $1.095 billion lost annually.

在美国，一半的成年人玩彩票。这意味着在任何一个家庭中，父母至少有一方可能会在彩票上下注。在菲律宾的家庭中，估计有300万菲律宾人定期赌彩票，但如果算上像“jueteng”或“斗鸡”这样的非法赌博项目，这个数字可能会翻两番。但让我们把注意力放在官方彩票上——一个平均每天赌1美元的人一年将花费大约365美元，这是统计上保证的净损失。再重复一遍，有300万的人傻乎乎的希望自己能赚到大钱，这是每年10.95亿美元的损失。

Hey, but it gives people hope, right?

嗨，但是它给了人们希望，对吧？

## Cryptocurrency Markets as a Choice  | 加密货币市场是一种选择

![schemes-3.jpeg](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1084915-75bfc017365727be.jpeg?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

Even though [governments are starting to embrace the use of cryptocurrencies,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory), a lot of elitist “experts” out there dismiss crypto-trading as a pointless exercise. They say you will be better off holding Bitcoins and sitting on your ass waiting for profits to come, and that these kids playing with these senseless “shitcoins” are going to get burned. It is risky, volatile, offers no guarantees, and has barely any consumer protection. To most people, that’s enough of a reason to stick to the lotto.

尽管[政府开始接受加密货币的使用](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory), 许多精英“专家”却认为加密货币交易是一种毫无意义的行为。他们说，你最好拿着比特币坐等利润的到来，而这些孩子玩这些愚蠢的“垃圾币”会被毁掉的。它有风险，不稳定，不提供担保，几乎没有任何消费者保护。对大多数人来说，这就足够让你坚持去玩彩票了。

![u=3737020437,1739643760&fm=11&gp=0.jpg](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1084915-8ed365f2f679b1e6.jpg?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

Yet there are many more out there who choose calculated risks over statistical improbabilities and are ready to take full control of their financial destiny. If an adult can make a decision to risk his or her small capital on a cryptocurrency project, then it is their right to do so. It’s a choice in a world where the choices are few and far between.

然而，还有更多的人选择计算风险统计的界定，并准备完全控制自己的财务命运。如果一个成年人决定在一个加密货币项目上冒险投资他或她的小额资本，这是他们的权利。在这个选择的机会少之又少的世界，这是一种选择。

It’s a risky choice, knowing the volatility of cryptocurrencies, but it’s a free choice. Thousands of people out there have decided that being in full control of their financial investments, no matter how small and no matter how risky, is better than gambling or allowing their hard-earned money to dwindle away slowly because of inflation and the rising cost of goods.

这是一个危险的选择，因为加密货币会剧烈波动，但这是一个自由的选择。成千上万的人已经决定完全控制他们自己的金融投资，无论多么小，无论多么危险，都好过赌博，好过辛苦赚来的钱因为通货膨胀和物价上涨而慢慢减少。

All that being said, a knowledgeable and hard-working cryptocurrency trader can churn $365 into a profit with the right tools and skills. I know this for a fact because I personally know people who are doing this as we speak, and we see social communities with members in the thousands sharing their knowledge and experiences with each other and helping each other learn the trade.

话虽如此，一个知识渊博、工作勤奋的加密货币交易员可以通过正确的工具和技能，将365美元转化为利润。我知道这一点，因为我个人知道，在我们讲话的时候，人们就在这么做，我们看到，有着成千上万个会员的社会团体中，人们互相分享他们的知识和经验，互相帮助，学习如何交易。

Young men and women who were earning minimum wage in a dead end job taught themselves to learn and earn from trading cryptocurrencies and are holding their savings in Bitcoin. Some of them were able to do well enough that they could quit their jobs and changed theirs and their families lives. This is a phenomenon that is spreading like wildfire not just in the Philippines but all over the world.

在一份前途暗淡的工作中赚取着最低工资的年轻男女，自学加密货币交易，并从中赚钱，将他们的积蓄换成了比特币来持有。他们中的一些人做得足够好，能够辞掉工作，改变他们自己和家人的生活。这一现象像野火一样蔓延，不仅在菲律宾，而且遍及全世界。


Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is an alternative for those without alternatives. It teaches them things they never thought they would learn about in their lifetimes — things like technical analysis, market behavior, game theory, derivatives, margin trading, reading charts — things that only wall street types are supposed to know about. Even I myself had barely any knowledge about these things until four years ago when I started our Bitcoin startup! Yet here we are, with Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies [having a combined half a trillion dollars in market capitalization](http://coinmarketcap.com/), [futures trading at the CBOE and CME](https://www.investopedia.com/news/cme-launch-bitcoin-futures/), and cryptocurrencies trading $15 Billion in volume on a daily basis, and growing.

比特币和加密货币交易，给了那些没有选择的人们一次机会。这教会了他们一生中从未想过的东西——诸如技术分析、市场行为、博弈论、衍生品、保证金交易、分析交易图——只有华尔街人士才会知道的东西。就连我自己也对这些东西几乎一无所知，直到四年前我创立了比特币公司! 但是现在, 比特币和加密货币[总计有一万亿美元的市值](http://coinmarketcap.com/),[在芝加哥期权交易所和芝加哥商品交易所期货交易](https://www.investopedia.com/news/cme-launch-bitcoin-futures/), 加密货币的日交易量达到了150亿美元，并且还在增长。


It’s a grassroots revolution led by people who want to take charge of their own financial future, people who know that lotteries and casinos are hopeless but didn’t had nowhere to go because they were too “small” for mainstream investment opportunities.

这是一场草根革命，由那些想要掌控自己的金融未来的人所领导，他们知道彩票和赌场是没有希望的，但也没有什么地方可去，因为他们对主流投资的机会而言太“小”了。

## A Global Financial Renaissance 全球金融复兴

![schemes-4.jpeg](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1084915-282138c71cb953f5.jpeg?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

Cryptocurrency markets will become an avenue that will give millions of people an opportunity to participate in a global financial network worth tens of trillions of dollars. From young millennials in developing nations with small savings and big ambitions to mom-and-pop business owners looking to reinvest some profits in promising crypto-projects, these kinds of people will be the backbone of this industry. Big players are coming in, yes, but don’t underestimate the underdogs — bloggers were not given much of a chance against big publishers back then too. The big players play with Bitcoin right now, but there are hundreds of alternatives.

加密货币市场将成为一种途径，让数百万人有机会参与价值数万亿美元的全球金融网络。从发展中国家的年轻的千禧一代，到那些拥有小积蓄和大抱负的发展中国家的企业家，他们希望在有前途的加密货币项目中再投资一些利润，这类人群将成为这个行业的支柱。大玩家进来了，是的，但不要低估了弱者——博客作者在当时也没有机会反对大出版商。现在，大玩家们正在玩比特币，但仍然有数百种可供选择。

When this industry matures, we will see the early trailblazers of today turning into educators and mentors, teaching the next generation about cryptocurrency markets. We will see simple, secure, and accessible platforms, with consumer protection as a standard, not just on the web but in mobile applications. We will see more mature financial instruments in the cryptocurrency markets, with lesser volatility and risk to the investor. A teenager in Manila will be able to trade crypto- derivatives with a grandmother in Florida. Everyone and anyone, with any amount of capital, will be able to invest in robust global markets. In fact, [we at SCI Ventures have already started this with our Keza app today.](http://getkeza.com/)

当行业成熟，我们会看到早期的先驱者变成教育者和导师，为下一代提供加密货币市场的教育。我们将看到简单、安全、可访问的平台，将消费者保护作为标准，不仅仅有web版，还有手机应用。我们将在加密货币市场上看到更成熟的金融工具，波动性较小，投资者面临的风险也更小。马尼拉的一名青少年将能够在佛罗里达与一位祖母交易加密货币衍生品。每个人，无论有多少资本，都将能够投资于健壮的全球市场。事实上，[我们SCI投资公司现在已经在Keza应用中启动了这个项目](http://getkeza.com/)。


Back to my original point, ponzi schemes succeed not because people are easily fooled but because people are desperate and don’t have many options to choose from. Hopefully, with the advent of new and viable options in the cryptocurrency space, more people will steer clear of these schemes.

回到我原来的观点，庞氏骗局之所以成功，不是因为人们容易受骗，而是因为人们非常绝望，没有太多选择。希望随着在加密货币空间中出现新的可行的选择，更多的人将避开这些骗局。

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies represent a major shift in how people can invest and trade in global capital markets. It opens up markets and eliminates a lot of barriers of entry to allow everyone to participate freely.

比特币和加密货币代表着人们在全球资本市场上投资和交易的重大转变。它打开了市场，消除了大量的准入门槛，让每个人都可以自由参与。

It’s exciting to watch this unfold today. It is a truly exciting time play a part in the growth of this industry.
看到这些正发生在今天，这很让人兴奋。能够参与到这个行业的发展之中，成为其中的一部分，实在激动人心。
