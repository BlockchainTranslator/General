Improving access to productive finance in Latin America and the Caribbean is the bottom line of our work.

The reason is simple: access to finance is essential for an economy and, therefore, a key determinant of its productivity and economic growth. The problem is that the financing of productive activities, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), can be jeopardized by issues related to the quality of information and contract execution, which hinder the tasks of credit selection, monitoring and asset recovery.

提高拉丁美洲和加勒比地区的生产性融资的机会是我们工作的底线。

原因很简单:获得融资对经济至关重要，更是决定其生产率和经济增长的关键因素。问题是，对生产活动特别是中小企业(中小企业)的融资，可能会因信息质量和合同执行等问题而受到损害，这将阻碍信贷选择、监控和资产恢复的任务。

This, in turn, drives up financing costs and sometimes it makes financing inviable. This problem is particularly prevalent in Latin America and the Caribbean, where it's critical development challenge that needs to be solved.

It is thus not surprising that over two years ago we got very intrigued, and eventually rather enthusiastic, about the potential of blockchain to address these problems. We became the first among multilateral development institutions to entertain the idea that if there was one strategic use case worth piloting, it was blockchain for asset registries.

这反过来又推高了融资成本，有时还会使融资变得不可行。这个问题在拉丁美洲和加勒比地区尤为普遍，在那里，这是一个亟待解决的关键发展挑战。

因此，在两年前，两年前我们对区块链解决这些问题的潜力非常感兴趣，并最终对区块链的潜力产生了兴趣，这一点也不奇怪。在多边开发机构中，我们第一个考虑到：如果有一个值得进行尝试的战略用例的话，那就是区块链的资产注册（登记）。

Importantly, though, we were not restricting our thoughts to land registries. These class of registries have been one of the most discussed applications, but they face severe challenges in our region given the particular nature of that specific asset and the registry: blockchain cannot not solve the "original owner" problem should disputes arise.

不过，重要的是，我们并没有把我们的想法限制在资产注册上。这类注册管理机构是最受欢迎的应用软件之一，但鉴于该特定资产和注册管理机构的特殊性，它们在本地区面临着严峻的挑战：区块链如果发生争议，不能解决“原始所有者”问题。

We refer here to a broader class of assets, such as moveable assets, warehouse receipts, invoices, etc., that could be used as collateral to access finance but remain largely untapped because their registries are untrusted and costly to operate, the information is difficult to verify and are prone to fraud.

Enter blockchain.

我们这里指的是更广泛的资产类别，比如可移动资产、仓库收据、发票等，这些资产可以用作融资的抵押品，但仍然很大程度上未被利用，因为它们的注册表不可信，操作成本高昂，信息难以核实，容易出现欺诈行为。

进入区块链。

## The promise
## 承诺

At a conceptual level, it is not difficult to see why the properties of blockchain make it particularly suitable candidate for the task of maintaining a collateral or asset registry:

1. The system is resilient, without a single point of failure or corruption
2. Cryptographic proofs provide integrity to the information contained in the ledger
3. The information is traceable and auditable, thereby providing enhanced transparency.

Moreover, smart contracts can further contribute to the efficiency of asset registries by allowing automatic execution of pledged collateral or its automatic un-pledge and re-pledge. These properties can dramatically decrease the costs associated with collateral management and improve efficiency.

在概念层面上，不难理解为什么区块链的特性使得它特别适合于维护抵押品或资产注册的任务:

1. 这个体系是有弹性的，没有单点故障或是腐败。
2. 加密证明提供了分类账本中所包含信息的完整性。
3. 这些信息是可追踪和可审计的，从而提供了更高的透明性。

此外，智能合约还可以通过自动执行抵押担保品或自动承诺和再抵押，从而进一步提高资产登记的效率。这些属性可以显著降低与抵押品管理相关的成本，并提高效率。

The premise then, seemed clear: More transparent and more efficient registries of assets pledged as collateral could diminish constraints rooted in information asymmetries and thus facilitate access to finance.

当时的前提似乎是清楚的：更加透明和更高效的抵押资产登记可以减少由信息不对称所造成的约束，从而有助于融资。

In other words, if blockchain could facilitate more accurate and trusted information regarding borrowers and contract execution, there would be many more SMEs in the economy that could access credit. This quickly evolved into a project with a vision: support the development of a foundation for a public, open-source infrastructure for asset registries using blockchain designed to support different applications for different type of assets, and implement a pilot to test it.

换句话说，如果区块链能够促进关于借款人和合约执行的更准确和可信的信息，那么在经济中就会有更多的中小企业能够获得信贷。这很快就演变成了一个具有远见的项目:支持使用区块链为资产注册管理机构开发公共基础设施的基础建设，以支持不同类型资产的不同应用，并实施一个试点来测试它。

What ensued was a journey that, frankly, was very similar to the famous Gartner hype cycle in the sense that while we began intrigued, we quickly got very excited and eventually a bit disillusioned.

接下来的旅程，坦白地说，与著名的Gartner公司的宣传周期非常相似，在我们开始感兴趣的时候，我们很容易就兴奋起来（开始幻想），最终幻想破灭。

## The certification problem
## 认证问题

There were different drivers that took us to the "trough of disillusionment," continuing with the analogy.

有不同的驱动因素把我们带到了“幻灭的低谷”，接下来继续这个比喻（举例说明）。

First, the avalanche of positive news that started in mid-2016 regarding the successful use of blockchain in different applications contributed to our inflated expectations.

But, we soon discovered that this news mostly referred to proof-of-concepts that were far from being piloted in real life, let alone in production. While this did not affect our intention to continue with the project, it showed us that there were not that many precedents we could built on.

首先，从2016年年中开始，有关区块链在不同应用程序中成功使用的积极消息，导致了我们过高的预期。

但是，我们很快发现，这个消息大多数是指在现实生活中远远没有被使用的概念证明，更不用说在生产中了。尽管这并没有影响我们继续推进这个项目的意愿，但它向我们表明，我们所能建立（引用）的先例并不多。

Second, during the process of actually designing the project, we started to realize that the devil is in the details, and that very few people were talking about these details. For instance, the "garbage in-garbage out" problem is not easy to solve. The objective is to have more trusted and transparent asset registries, but it all depends on whether the initial information registered is correct or has not been altered.

其次，在实际设计项目的过程中，我们开始意识到，魔鬼（困难点）在细节中，很少有人在谈论这些细节。例如，“垃圾处理”问题并不容易解决。其目标是拥有更可信和透明的资产注册，但这取决于初始信息的注册是否正确或未被修改。

The problem is that, at least at the entry point, we still need to engage and trust third parties that the technology is touted to eliminate. And while there are interesting and novel ways to use different technologies to put a limit on potential corruption at entry, at the end of the day this problem is not fully solved, and if garbage gets in, it will get out, and possibly on a higher standing as it was "blockchain certified."

问题是，至少在初始入口点，我们仍然需要第三方——技术上认为这已经可以被消除——的参与并对之信任。尽管有很多有趣和新颖的方式使用不同的技术来限制潜在腐败条目,但是最终这个问题还没有完全解决，如果垃圾信息进入,它出去之后,可能有更高的标准（取信度），因为它是经过“区块链认证”的。

Nonetheless, if the entry point issue is solved, then the system is indeed helpful as it will provide integrity to the information.

尽管如此，如果入口点的问题得到了解决，那么系统确实会很有帮助，因为它将为信息提供完整性。

## Practical concerns
## 实际问题

More broadly, though, there are several issues arising from the "off-chain/on-chain" interactions, especially when the main data resides, and the main transactions occur, off-chain.

不过，更广泛地说，有几个问题是由“off-chain/on-chain”（链上链下）交互产生的，特别是（例如）当主要交易发生时，主要数据却驻留在链下（难以交互）。

A promising avenue to address this problem is to design the off-chain transaction systems in such a way that they automatically generate smart contracts to settle the transactions on chain, but this is the subject of further research that we are conducting.

解决这个问题的一个很有希望的途径是设计出一种离线交易系统，这样他们就可以自动生成智能合约来处理链上的交易，而这是我们正在进行的进一步研究的主题。

Another major, practical, issue relates to the costs and uncertainties when undertaking a pilot in the real world, even more so in the context of a developing economy. Let's start with transactions costs. Imagine we want to use the bitcoin blockchain.

另一个主要的、实际的问题是在现实世界中进行试点时的成本和不确定性，在发展中经济体的情况下更是如此。让我们从交易成本开始。假想一下我们使用比特币区块链的情况。

Well, the price per bitcoin has increased more than 2,000 percent since we started thinking of the pilot, and despite batching and other techniques, the price increases and volatility of public blockchains affect transaction costs for a project like this, and they are not easy to plan or budget.

好吧，自从我们开始考虑试点以来，比特币的价格已经上涨了超过2000个百分点，尽管有批量生产和其他技术，但是价格的上涨和公共区块链的波动影响了这样一个项目的交易成本，使得他们不容易计划或预算。

This holds true even in hybrid models because even if most activity occurs in the private blockchain, a reference still needs to be registered in a public blockchain. But well beyond these transactions costs, running a blockchain pilot does not come cheap.

即使在混合模型中也是如此，因为即使大部分活动发生在私人区块链中，仍需要在公共区块链中注册参考。但是，除了这些交易成本外，运行区块链试点并不便宜。

A pilot, by definition, entails a small-scale, short-term experiment undertaken to learn how it might work in practice. This means that whatever system is built to be piloted, it would need to operate as a mirror of current systems.

Furthermore, a pilot like this needs to connect the systems of several stakeholders (for instance financial institutions, government dependencies, users and other players, depending on the use-case), which is usually not easy or cheap.

根据定义，一个试点需要进行一项小规模的短期实验，以了解它在实际中如何运作。这意味着，无论构建什么系统，它都需要作为当前系统的镜像。

此外，像这样的试点需要连接几个利益相关者的系统(例如金融机构、政府依赖关系、用户和其他参与者，这取决于用例)，这通常不容易也不便宜。

## Charging ahead
## 收费（付出成本）

Yes, undertaking a blockchain pilot entails investing a non-trivial amount of resources. Moreover, there is a multiplicity of risks to plan for and the reality is that the conclusion of the pilot might not be positive.

So, is the endeavor worth the cost and the trouble?

是的，承担一个区块链的试点项目需要投资大量的资源。此外，计划的风险是多种多样的，而且实际情况是，试点的结论可能时消极的。

那么，付出的代价和麻烦是值得的吗?

We think it is indeed. Not only because the potential development gains can be very high if it works, but because right now there is need for more basic research and experimentation with blockchain without worrying about direct commercial applications.

Moreover, the timing is ripe for pursuing an initiative aimed to support and test an open-source, public infrastructure that allows for greater innovation at the edges (i.e. the application layer), while offering the opportunity to start thinking about standards at the foundational level.

我们认为答案是肯定的。这不仅是因为，如果它能起作用，潜在的开发收益就会非常高，还因为现在还需要更多的基础研究和试验，而不是去担心直接的商业应用。

此外，实施旨在支持和测试开放源代码的公共基础设施的倡议的时机已经成熟，该公共基础设施允许在边缘（即应用层）进行更大的创新，同时提供了机会开始考虑基础层面的标准。

Also, the trait of an extensible, open and public infrastructure is very relevant for applications that entail public interest or development objectives, as the main code can be reused, improved, and adapted to the specific needs of different countries.

此外，可扩展、开放和公共基础设施的特征与涉及公共利益或开发目标的应用程序非常相关，因为主要代码可以重用、改进和适应不同国家的特定需求。

As such, and considering that many asset registries would benefit from enhanced auditability, traceability, and transparency, through this project we seek to contribute to the pioneer testing of blockchain in registries with high development impact potential.

因此，同时也考虑到许多资产注册中心将受益于增强的可审核性、可追溯性和透明性，通过这个项目，我们将致力于为具有高开发影响潜力的注册中心进行区块链的先驱测试。

We are hopeful that, if all works as intended, we will be able to enter a plateau of productivity sooner than later.

我们希望，如果一切按计划进行，我们的生产力将能够更快地达到稳定时期。
