I first seriously heard about cryptocurrency while I was working on Wall Street.

This was in 2013. I was trading Argentine credit. One of my local brokers in Buenos Aires wanted to know if I had knew anything about bitcoin. Argentina, at the time, had been locked out of capital markets for over a decade. The peso, ostensibly pegged to the US dollar, traded at a discount on the ground, leaving locals hungry for other stores of value. Capital controls meant that getting money offshore often involved suitcases and ferries to Uruguay. The country was on the brink of another default.

The promise of bitcoin, in this context, was a store of value that would not be captive to the ineptitude or harm of a single, central authority.

当我在华尔街工作的时候，我第一次听说了加密货币。

这是在2013年。我在交易阿根廷信贷。我在布宜诺斯艾利斯的一个本地经纪人想知道我是否了解比特币。当时，阿根廷已经被封闭在资本市场之外长达10年之久。表面上与美元挂钩的peso在当地市场上以折扣价格进行交易，这使得当地人对其他商品的价值感到渴望。资本管制意味着，把资金转移到海外通常需要用手提箱和渡船去乌拉圭。该国正处于另一种违约的边缘。

在这种情况下，比特币的承诺是一种价值储备，它不会被一个中央权威机构的不称职或伤害所俘虏。

As I dug further into bitcoin, more promises of an alternative, improved financial system presented themselves. The European debt crisis, and specifically the asset seizures in Cyprus, highlighted the significance of a digital store of value that could be owned directly – that could not be compromised by an external actor.

Here was an asset that did not demand an intermediary. Sitting on a trading desk at the time, the removal of rent-seeking middlemen from the system was particularly compelling. This technology could allow counterparties to interact directly, without having to disclose the details of their transactions or identities to third parties.

This was also an asset that was programmable. As a derivatives trader, I spent a lot of time thinking about counterparty exposure, collateral and capital requirements. Could smart contracts provide an automatically enforceable means of accounting for this sort of systemic risk?

随着我深入研究比特币，更多的承诺，一个替代，改善的金融体系呈现出来。欧洲债务危机，尤其是塞浦路斯的资产扣押事件，突显出数字商品价值的重要性，这种价值可以直接拥有，而不会被外部参与者所损害。

这是一种不需要中介的资产。当时坐在交易台上，从金融体系中去除寻租中间商的行为特别引人注目。这种技术可以让交易双方直接互动，而不必向第三方披露他们的交易或身份的细节。

这也是一种可编程的资产。作为一名衍生品交易者，我花了很多时间考虑交易双方的风险、担保和资本要求。智能合约能否为这种系统性风险提供一种自动执行的审计方法?

It had not taken me long to grow disillusioned with the old financial system. Insider trading went on at scale. Reckless risk-taking was often rewarded. Market manipulation, under the guise of many different names, remained rampant.

并不需要多长时间，我就对旧的金融体系感到很失望。内幕交易大规模进行。不计后果的冒险行为往往得到回报。以许多不同的名义为幌子——市场操纵行为依然猖獗。

Cryptocurrency promised an alternative to this system.

For many, 2017 will be the year that they first seriously heard about bitcoin. As I consider the state of cryptocurrency today, however, I don’t see many fulfilled promises.

加密货币承诺将会有一个替代方案。

对许多人来说，2017年将是他们第一次正经听说比特币的一年。然而，在我考虑到加密货币的现状时，我并没有看到多少承诺得到兑现。

Instead, we have constructed around crypto a warped version of the legacy financial system, with all the familiar players: issuers, broker dealers, exchanges and custodians. Along with these players come the legacy problems of centralized control, intermediation, systemic risk, market malpractice and – importantly – short-term greed.

We may think that we are down the crypto rabbit hole, but really we are through the Wall Street looking glass.

相反，我们围绕加密构建了传统金融体系的一个扭曲版本，所有参与者都是熟悉的:发行商、经纪人、交易所和托管方。随着这些参与者的出现，中央集权控制、中介化、系统性风险、市场失当行为以及重要的短期贪婪（短视）等问题都出现了。

我们可能认为我们是在加密领域的地下洞穴里，但实际上我们只是实现了华尔街的镜像。

## Issuers
## 发行商

Cryptocurrency tends to be marketed as "trustless." A truer way of thinking about it is that can replace the necessity of trusting a single, central authority with the ability to trust a network of decentralized actors.

Cryptocurrency倾向于被认为是“不信任的（不可靠的）”。一种更真实的思考方式是，能够取代一个信任单一的中央权威并信任一个由去中心化的参与者组成的网络的能力。”

Many of the tokens that have emerged in the last year, however, have been issued by small teams of entrepreneurs, who must be trusted to get the project off the ground. Thanks to the cryptocurrency community’s emphasis on open source development, later-stage work often proceeds in a more decentralized manner.

然而，去年出现的许多代币都是由小企业家发行的，必须信任这些小企业才能实施这个项目。由于加密货币社区对开源开发的重视，后期工作通常以更去中心化的方式进行。

Nonetheless, investors and consumers need to reconcile the dissonance between the sales pitch of decentralization and the reality of how these projects are often run in their early days.

尽管如此，投资者和消费者之间需要调和去中心化的销售说辞与这些项目早期经营的现实之间的矛盾。

The paradox of centralized cryptocurrency creation is perhaps nowhere so clearly on display as in Venezuela. The Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, announced a few weeks ago his intent to issue a cryptocurrency, presumably in order to evade sanctions. This is unlikely to work, but it also misses the point. A promise of bitcoin is to act as a store of value that would not be captive to a central authority.

中心化（中央）创造加密货币的悖论在委内瑞拉体现的非常明显。委内瑞拉总统Nicolas Maduro几周前宣布，他打算发行一种加密货币，大概是为了逃避制裁。这是不可能奏效的，而且也没有抓住要点。因为比特币的承诺之一是作为一种不会被中央政府控制的价值储藏手段。

A new Venezuelan cryptocurrency, if issued by Maduro, is just as likely to be mismanaged as the bolivar.

如果Maduro发行的一种新的委内瑞拉加密货币，就像bolivar一样，可能会被错误地管理。

Other assets also make this point. Tether is an example of a centrally-mismanaged token. It claims to be a fully-collateralized, dollar-backed asset. The fact that it is not redeemable, coupled with the opaque and problematic accounting practices of its issuers, however, makes it as questionable as any of Wall Street's financial creations, if not more so.

其他资产也表明了这一点。Tether是一个中心化管理的代币的例子。它声称是一种完全抵押的，美元支持的资产。然而，它无法赎回，再加上发行方的不透明和有问题的会计做法，使得它与华尔街的任何金融产品一样令人质疑。

Decentralization is a transformative concept in finance and technology. But if the source of value for these products still relies on a central issuer, then how different are they from the financial products that Wall Street has been devising for decades?

去中心化是金融和技术的一个变革概念。但是，如果这些产品的价值来源仍然依赖于一个中央发行机构，那么它们与华尔街几十年来所设计的金融产品有何不同呢?

## Intermediaries
## 中介机构

Cryptocurrency is also talked about as a disintermediating technology. The peer-to-peer nature of blockchain-based assets is perhaps their most interesting feature.

The reality of how these assets are generally being transacted and custodied, however, is highly intermediated.

加密货币也被认为是一种去中介技术。基于区块链的资产的点对点特性也许是他们最有趣的特性。

然而，这些资产现实中的交易和监管通常是高度中介化的。

The professionalization of the issuance process is one example of cryptocurrency markets replicating the legacy system. The services provided by investment banks in equity capital markets are now getting packaged and sold to teams of entrepreneurs looking to do token sales.

These services include running diligence on investors, book-building, addressing compliance concerns and handling the legal process. On the one hand, this marks an important initiative in maturing the market. On the other, it is recreating Wall Street's system around this new asset class.

发行过程的专业化是加密货币复制遗留系统的一个例子。投资银行在股权资本市场提供的服务，现在正被打包出售给希望做代币销售的企业家团队。

这些服务包括对投资者进行尽职调查、询价、处理合规问题以及处理法律程序。一方面，这标志着成熟市场的一项重要举措。另一方面，它正在重新创造华尔街围绕着这个新的资产类别的体系。

The platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies and tokens also fit this category. The development of over-the-counter trading desks in cryptocurrency feels particularly ironic for me, given I first really understood bitcoin’s value proposition while sitting on a trading desk myself. These desks and exchanges undoubtedly play critical roles in providing liquidity to the market, but in many ways they are replicating what we knew from the old system.

为加密货币和代币交易提供便利的平台也符合这一类别。对我来说，加密货币场外交易平台的发展对我来说特别具有讽刺意味，因为我本人第一次真正了解比特币的价值主张（去中心化）。这些服务商和交易所无疑在为市场提供流动性方面扮演着关键角色，但从许多方面来说，它们正在复制我们从旧体系中了解到的东西。

For this reason, decentralized exchange is one of the most compelling areas of research in the space. Rather than rebuild the legacy exchanges, decentralized exchange seeks to enable a new way of transacting that is truer to the value proposition of the technology.

Wallets, like exchanges, have been significant in driving adoption of, speculation on, and use of cryptocurrency. Interaction with private keys remains a real user experience challenge. While many do choose to self-custody their cryptocurrencies, and the very option to do so is one of the important features of this asset class, we have yet to see a product enable secure and reasonable private key custody without reliance on third parties.

因此，去中心化交易方式是这个领域最引人注目的研究领域之一。去中心化交易不是重建传统的交易所，而这种交易方式更真实地反映了技术的价值主张。

与交易所一样，钱包在推动人们接受比特币、投机和使用加密货币方面发挥了重要作用。与私钥的交互仍然是一个真正的用户体验挑战。尽管许多人选择自行保管他们的加密货币，（选择这种方式是这一资产类别的重要特征之一），但我们还没有看到一款产品能够在不依赖第三方的情况下启用安全、合理的私钥托管。

In place of this, the industry has again created mirror images of the legacy system: professional custody services using everything from safe deposit boxes to Swiss bank vaults.

These mirror images of Wall Street have a distorted quality. Not only do they imprecisely (or immaturely) resemble the old financial infrastructure on which they are based, but they also bend and corrupt the original intent of the product. Cryptocurrency has created more intermediaries than it has displaced.

The intent was to give people direct control of their funds, free from seizure from banks and governments. Instead, people are handing over that control to a new class of actors--who are frequently even less accountable than their old school counterparts.

在这方面，该行业再次创造出了遗留系统的镜像:专业的托管服务，从安全的存款箱到瑞士银行的金库。

华尔街的这些镜像反映出了一种扭曲的质量。它们不仅不精确(或不成熟)，与它们所基于的旧的金融基础设施相似，而且它们也扭曲和破坏了产品最初的意图。Cryptocurrency创造了更多的中间媒介，多于他们所取代的。

加密货币目的是让人们直接控制他们的资金，免于银行和政府的扣押。但现在，取而代之的是，人们把控制权交给了一群新一代的演员（行为者）——他们往往比他们的老同行更不负责。

## Institutions
## 机构

The question of institutional accountability speaks directly to another promise of cryptocurrency. With its capacity for programmability, crypto can enforce financial contracts. This could solve issues of collateral management and guarantee compliance with capital requirements. The 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated, in part, by a lack of clarity about exposures among counterparties. Auditability and enforceability inherent to crypto should help mitigate, or at least reveal, this kind of systemic risk.

机构问责制的问题直接世接到加密货币的另一个承诺。通过它的可编程性，加密可以执行财务合约。这可以解决抵押品管理的问题，并保证符合资本要求。2008年的金融危机在一定程度上是由于对交易双方的风险敞口缺乏透明度而加剧的。加密的可审核性和可执行性应该有助于减轻或至少揭示这种系统性风险。

However, the third parties that have been created around cryptocurrency equally exposed to each other as banks, exchanges, and custodians were in 2008.

然而，随着银行、交易所和托管机构的出现，围绕加密货币创建的第三方也得到了创建，正如2008年一样。

Commingling of funds within wallets and exchanges, opaque accounting, cross-exchange exposure and unclear margin requirements are a few of the sources of institutional risk in the market. The relative lack of standards in cryptocurrency means that these risks are poorly studied and understood. Disclosures on the subject have yet to be widely demanded by customers and are far from commonplace.

The nascent infrastructure growing up around cryptocurrency reflects the institutions of Wall Street. It’s little wonder that the same risks persist.

在钱包和交易所内的资金混合、不透明的会计、交叉交易风险和不明确的保证金要求，是市场中一些机构风险的来源。加密货币相对缺乏标准意味着这些风险的研究和理解都很不充分。关于这一问题的披露尚未得到客户的广泛要求，而且还远未普及。

围绕加密货币的新兴基础设施，反映了华尔街的制度。同样的风险仍然存在，这一点也不奇怪。

## Integrity
## 正直

The parallels between the old and the new are not limited to issuers, infrastructure and institutions. The parallels also permeate the integrity of the players in the system.

Market manipulation, insider trading, shilling, spoofing, pumping-and-dumping and conflicts of interest abound in cryptocurrency markets. This comes as no surprise to anyone who has sat on a Wall Street trading desk, especially considering the relative immaturity of crypto markets.

新旧之间的相似之处并不局限于发行者、基础设施和机构。这种相似之处也渗透到系统中玩家的正直（道德）。

市场操纵、内幕交易、先令、欺骗、抽空和利益冲突在加密货币市场比比皆是。对于那些坐在华尔街交易室的人来说，这并不奇怪，而考虑到加密市场的相对不成熟，这就更见怪不怪了。

When I was a trader, I found myself acutely aware that Wall Street might be the hub of it all, but somewhere – on the other end of all the Bloomberg screens, and broker-dealers, and custodians, and clearing houses, and asset managers and mutual funds – were individuals and their retirement money or their college savings.

当我还是一名交易者的时候，我发现自己清楚地意识到，华尔街可能是所有这一切的中心，但在所有彭博银行的屏幕，经纪交易商，托管人人，结算所和资产管理公司的另一端共同基金 - 是个人和他们的退休金或他们的大学储蓄。

The same is becoming true of cryptocurrency as retail consumers buy in.

Initiatives and standards are starting to emerge within the industry. Like so much else in crypto markets, these initiatives largely reflect lessons learned by Wall Street. Disclosures by journalists, pundits, and fund managers are starting to become commonplace. Messari, an open source EDGAR-like database, is offering transparency to investors on newly-issued tokens. The Brooklyn Project, launched by Consensys, focuses on consumer protection and setting standards for tokens, encouraging self-regulation by issuers.

随着零售消费者的购买，加密货币的情况也变得如此。

行业内已经出现了一些行动和标准。与加密市场的其他领域一样，这些举措在很大程度上反映了华尔街的经验教训。记者，专家和基金经理的披露正变得司空见惯。 Messari是一个开源EDGAR数据库，为投资者提供新发行的代币透明度。由Consensys发起的布鲁克林项目侧重于消费者保护和制定代币标准，鼓励发行人自我约束。

Even Coinbase's probe into employee insider trading demonstrates that it is taking its role in the market – and setting standards for it – seriously.

As Wall Street learned for itself, accountability is an important market practice. These are important developments not just for consumer protection, but also for the growth and longevity of the market as a whole.

甚至Coinbase也要对员工内幕交易进行调查，这表明，它正在认真对待自己在市场中的角色，并为其制定标准。

正如华尔街所了解的，问责制是一项重要的市场实践。这些都是重要的发展，不仅是为了保护消费者，也是为了整个市场的增长和长久发展。

## Long-term greedy
## 长期贪婪

If the hype in 2016 was all about replacing Wall Street's infrastructure with blockchain technology, then 2017 was all about replicating Wall Street’s infrastructure around crypto.

This has led us astray of many of the original promises of cryptocurrency: promises about the roles of issuers, of intermediaries, and of institutions. The level of integrity in the market, unfortunately, also reflects that of the old system, exacerbated by general market immaturity and a lack of agreed-upon standards.

如果2016年的炒作都是关于用区块链技术取代华尔街的基础设施，那么2017年的全部内容就是围绕着加密技术复制华尔街的基础设施。

这让我们对加密货币的许多最初承诺产生了误解:关于发行商、中介和机构的角色的承诺。不幸的是，市场上的正直程度也反映了旧体制的问题，更是由于加密市场普遍不成熟和缺乏公认的标准而加剧。

"Long term greedy" is a notion that crypto would do well to borrow from Wall Street. The idea is that certain behaviors, while they may benefit you less in the short term, will pay off in the long run.

These behaviors include having a steady hand in volatile markets, something cryptocurrency investors are well familiar with. More importantly, though, these behaviors also entail respecting other market participants.

“长期贪婪”是一种概念，即加密可以从华尔街借钱（华尔街投资者和资金进入加密市场）。他们的想法是，某些行为虽然在短期内会让你受益较少，但从长远来看会有所回报。

这些行为包括在动荡的市场中稳步发展，这是一种加密货币投资者所熟悉的东西。当然，更重要的是，这些行为也需要考虑到其他市场的参与者。

I think 2018 will see cryptocurrency markets continue to grow up and self-regulate. 2018 will teach us that being long term greedy is about more than holding – it’s also about maintaining integrity.

Finally, 2018 may return us to some of the original intent of cryptocurrency as the market awakens to remember that the real value lies not through the looking glass, but in the original promises of decentralization and disintermediation.

我认为，在2018年，加密货币市场将继续成长，并自我监管。2018年将告诉我们，长期贪婪不仅仅是持有——它还关乎保持正直（信仰）。

最后，2018年可能会让我们回到加密货币的初衷，因为市场可能会使我们机器，加密货币真正的价值不是华尔街的镜像，而是在于最初承诺的去中心化和去中介化。
