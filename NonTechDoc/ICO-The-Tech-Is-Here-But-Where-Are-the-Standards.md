Let's face facts: initial coin offerings (ICOs) have done more this year to encourage the adoption of blockchain technology, as well as its activity, invention, debate and reaction, than just about anything else in the industry.

让我们来面对事实:今年的首次代币发行(ICOs)鼓励采用区块链技术，以及它（区块链）的活动、发明、辩论和反应，而不仅仅是行业内的其他任何东西。

Many technological purists are skeptical about this. They roll their eyes. They look forward to a more sophisticated future for blockchains. This is very understandable, but it's also short-sighted. Tokens and ICOs are a "killer app," a truly great use case that will spur adoption.

许多技术纯粹主义者对此表示怀疑。他们不以为然。他们期待着区块链更加成熟的未来。这是可以理解的，但也是短视的。代币和ICOs是一个“杀手级应用”，这是一个非常好的使用案例，将会促进区块链技术的采用。

Of course, it's still early days, and there's a lot more work to do. For the purists, at the very least, it is undeniable that the extraordinary increase of interest in ethereum, in particular, and the fiat price of ETH, has coincided with the ICO phenomenon.

当然，现在还为时尚早，还有很多工作要做。对纯粹主义者来说，至少，不可否认的是，对以太坊有极高的兴趣，特别是对ETH的非同寻常的上涨的价格感兴趣，这是由于ICO的现象所导致的。

Many regard this first wave of tokens as similar to internet 1.0, and they are more interested in, so to speak, "tokens 2.0." Everyone else wants better technology, too, but the importance of innovation in standards or culture should not be underestimated. White papers, posts to GitHub and blog posts about token investment criteria are all part of what we might call "best practice 1.0."

许多人认为这第一批代币与互联网1.0相似，他们更感兴趣的是“代币2.0”。每个人都希望有更好的技术，但对标准或文化的创新的重要性不容低估。白皮书，GitHub的帖子以及关于代币投资标准的博客帖子都是我们所谓的“最佳实践1.0”的一部分。

Entering 2018, the blockchain community must review "best practice 1.0" from the last year and, alongside technology, begin working toward "best practice 2.0."

进入2018年，区块链社区必须回顾去年的“最佳实践1.0”，并与技术一起开始朝“最佳实践2.0”的方向努力。

## Consumer satisfaction
## 消费者满意度

True to the spirit of blockchains, the ICO phenomenon this year has been very decentralized.

Projects across all sorts of areas and all over the world popped up. Anyone was free to launch a project and anyone was free to participate. Again, true to the spirit of blockchains, people have experimented for themselves, created and launched projects, committed their ETH and done so with very few obligations or expectations beyond the execution of the smart contract.

就像区块链的精神一样，今年的ICO现象已经非常分散。

各个领域和世界各地的项目都出现了。任何人都可以自由地发起一个项目，任何人都可以自由参与。再一次，对于区块链的精神，人们已经为自己进行了试验，创建并启动了项目，提交了他们的ETH，除了执行智能合约之外，几乎没有什么义务或期望。

In many ways this was very liberating, but a lack of obligation or expectation too often meant a lack of responsibility or accountability, principally toward ICO participants. Many participants did focus on the technological promises of the projects to which they committed their ETH. Many also saw ICOs as a path to financial gain… and this is where everything began to get difficult.

从很多方面来说，这是一种解放，但缺乏义务或期望往往意味着缺乏问责或责任感，主要是对ICO的参与者。许多参与者都把注意力集中在他们所参与的项目的技术承诺上。许多人还将ICOs视为获取财务收益的途径……而这正是一切开始变得困难的地方。

Technology is just one part of a successful project. Organization, management, a well-considered plan, risk mitigating measures, communication and full and fair explanations about what someone can expect are also important. ICOs began to run into difficulty because there have not been clear standards and delivery on a project in line with expectations.

For example, some projects attracted a lot more for their ICO than either expected or planned for. Questions arose about how to deal with that excess:

* Which participants get how many tokens?
* Is it fair to keep the excess or should it be returned?
* Do you issue more tokens?
These are just some of many questions.

技术只是一个成功项目的一部分。组织、管理、深思熟虑的计划、风险缓解措施、沟通以及对某人所期望的内容的全面、公正的解释也很重要。ICOs开始遇到困难，因为在项目中正如预料的：没有明确的标准和交付。

例如，一些ICO为他们的项目吸引了比预期或计划更多的资金。关于如何处理过剩的问题出现了一些问题:

* 哪些参与者得到了多少代币?
* 保留多余的还是应该归还?
* 您是否发行更多的代币?
这些只是许多问题的一部分。

Even worse, some projects have attracted attention for straying from the plans they set out in their white papers. With no preparation, there were no answers. This has meant many ICO participants were left dissatisfied.

更糟糕的是，一些项目吸引了人们的注意力，因为他们偏离了他们在白皮书中提出的计划。没有准备，就没有答案。这意味着许多的参与者都不满意。

## Ethical considerations
## 道德的考虑

Regulators are primarily concerned with protecting the integrity of the market and protecting investors.

Something in the form of ICOs, that was unexpected and not initially technically well understood, thus set off many warning signals and in some cases resulted in real loss and grievance. The reaction has been very understandably to err on the side of caution. The string of bans, warnings, statements and even lawsuits which began in September should have been entirely predictable.

监管机构主要关注的是保护市场的完整性和保护投资者。

ICO的形式出乎意料，在技术上并不是很容易理解的，因此引发了许多警告信号，在某些情况下导致了真正的损失和不满。出于谨慎的考虑，这个反应是非常可以理解的。今年9月开始的一系列禁令、警告、声明甚至诉讼都是完全可以预见的。

Many in the blockchain community compare the stage of development and adoption to the early days of the internet.

If we are in 'internet 1.0,' or 'token 1.0,' or 'best practice 1.0,' then we should consider what other lessons we can learn. When popular use of the internet first started, very few people thought about, predicted or understood that there might be ethical, rather than technological issues, that we'd have to try to figure out. These were issues like privacy, intellectual property violation, identity theft, internet bullying. Recent fears about state propaganda and election interference were certainly not anticipated.

区块链社区的许多人将开发和采用的阶段与互联网的早期阶段进行了比较。

如果我们在“互联网1.0”或“令牌1.0”或“最佳实践1.0”中，那么我们应该考虑我们能学到什么。当人们开始使用互联网的时候，很少有人想到，预测或者理解，可能会有道德问题，而不是技术问题，需要我们努力去解决。这些问题包括隐私、侵犯知识产权、身份盗窃、网络欺凌等。最近人们对国家宣传和选举干预的担心当时是没有预料到的。

What will the concerns of the future be when it comes to cryptocurrencies, blockchains and ICOs?

It will likely take some time and it is very likely that we won’t predict them. However, we can certainly start thinking differently. Technological innovation is only one half of what the community needs to consider.

We must also give serious thought to standards, or cultural, or ethical innovation.

当涉及到加密货币、区块链和ICOs时，人们对未来的担忧是什么?

这很可能需要一段时间，很有可能我们无法预测。然而，我们可以从不同的角度开始思考。技术革新只是社区需要考虑的一半。

我们还必须认真考虑标准、文化或伦理创新。

## Regulation isn't a panacea
## 监管不是灵丹妙药

Regulation and new laws may be a welcome start, but they are also not a complete solution.

监管和新法律可能是一个受欢迎的开始，但它们也不是一个完整的解决方案。

Although bitcoin was originally started with the intention of taking aim at the traditional financial sector, there are lessons we can learn from the past. There are many good ideas, standards and best practices which we can review and adapt. There is no reason not to keep the best that traditional financial services had to offer, to keep what was good and worked, and adapt it for the best fit with the realities of new technology.

After all, regulators themselves only have so many resources, whether that’s time or expertise. They also often have mandates not to act in ways which hinder new business and innovation. They often make very reasonable efforts. The reason we have seen bans and warnings is not that regulators are against innovation. They just don't want to be caught out by it.

尽管比特币最初的初衷是将目标瞄准传统的金融领域，但我们依然可以从过去吸取经验教训。传统有许多好的想法、标准和最佳实践，值得我们去进行回顾和调整。我们没有理由不保留传统金融服务所提供的最好的服务，以保持良好和有效的服务，并使之适应新技术来临的现实。

毕竟，监管机构自身只有这么多的资源，无论是时间还是专业知识。他们还常常要求不采取妨碍新商业和创新的方式。他们经常做出非常合理的努力。我们看到禁令和警告的原因并不是监管机构反对创新。他们只是不想出错。

Yet, regulators can only provide so much of the answer. For example, the way that hedge funds became mainstream was by developing their own industry norms and standards which acted in a complementary way to regulation. These kinds of standards reduced the risk for investors, created reliable expectations and ultimately allowed that industry to flourish.

然而，监管者只能提供如此多的答案。例如，对冲基金成为主流的方式是通过制定自己的行业规范和标准来实现对监管的补充。这些标准降低了投资者的风险，创造了可靠的预期，并最终使这个行业蓬勃发展。

We should expect to see these kinds of standards and industry practices begin to take shape next year for ICOs. Instead of being shut down indefinitely, the blockchain community must take some responsibility for itself. That is how the industry can figuratively grow up and it’s how we can move forward and increase adoption. If you want to go "to the moon" then that’s how you get there.

我们应该期待看到这些标准和行业惯例将在明年开始成形。区块链社区必须为自己承担一些责任，而不是无限期地关闭。这就是该行业如何成长的方式，也是我们如何前进和增强采用的方式。如果你想去月球，那这就是你到达月球的方式。

The good news is that over the last year there have been some very encouraging signs.

The Government of Gibraltar, which has experience in fostering the growth of online gaming, announced that it would introduce a new "Distributed Ledger Technology Regulatory Framework" which is due to pass into law in 2018. Instead of acting prescriptively and prohibitively it instead sets principles for conduct of business.

In the U.S., there is a team developing EDGAR-style rules for ICOs. Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) rules are information-filing standards that were originally intended to increase fairness in the securities market.

The SEC has issued some guidance about what kind of tokens can be classified as securities and which are not, and issued guidance on celebrity endorsements. The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has started a supervisory regime for cryptocurrency exchanges.

好消息是，在过去的一年里，出现了一些令人鼓舞的迹象。

直布罗陀政府曾在促进网络游戏发展方面有过经验，它宣布将引入新的“去中心化分类账本技术监管框架”，该框架将于2018年通过法律。它不是采取规定和禁止的方式，相反，是为商业行为设定了原则。

在美国有一个团队开发了edgaro风格的ICOs规则。电子数据收集、分析和检索(埃德加)规则是信息归档标准，最初的目的是提高证券市场的公平性。

美国证交会已经发布了一些指导意见，说明哪些类型的代币可以归类为证券，哪些不是，并发布了有关名人代言的指导意见。日本金融厅(FSA)已经启动了一项针对加密货币交易的监管机制。

## Toward best practice 2.0
## 迈向最佳实践2.0

These are all great signs that, whether they understand it or not, or whether it's particularly coordinated, market participants are in the early stages of building best practice 2.0.

这些都是很好的迹象，无论他们是否理解，或者是否特别协调，市场参与者都处于构建最佳实践2.0的早期阶段。

If we want the next year to be better and a clear improvement on the last, these are some of the most important questions we must answer:

* What criteria do we use to decide whether a token is a security?
* What standards should apply to non-security “utility” tokens?
* Who should be allowed to issue tokens?
* How do you identify a good service provider?
* Who should be able to buy what kind of token?
* What can I say about my project?
* What are good technological, governance, risk management, planning, and commercial standards?
* Who do we hold accountable for what?
The blockchain community has an opportunity to be proactive and to start answering some of these questions themselves. Too often a raising of standards or change of practice is a response to what should have been a completely avoidable disaster. The fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, the same crisis which led Satoshi Nakamoto to create bitcoin in the first place, is an apt example. This past year has already seen law suits filed and the SEC start to file its first fraud charges. There are rumors of more charges to come and of regulators investigating with the intention to prosecute..

如果我们想让明年变得更好，并在最后实现一个明显的改善，这就是我们必须回答的一些最重要的问题:

* 我们用什么标准来决定一个代币是否安全?
* 什么标准应该应用于非安全的“实用”代币?
* 应该允许谁发行代币?
* 您如何确定一个好的服务商?
* 谁应该能买到什么代币?
* 关于我的项目，我能说些什么呢?
* 什么是好的技术、治理、风险管理、规划和商业标准?
* 我们应该对什么负责?
区块链社区有机会积极主动地开始回答其中的一些问题。通常情况下，提高标准或改变实践是对本应是完全可避免的灾难的反应。2008年金融危机的余波，同样的危机，导致Satoshi Nakamoto首先创造了比特币，这是一个恰当的例子。在过去的一年里，已经出现了法律诉讼，而SEC也开始提起它的第一个欺诈指控。有传言说将会有更多的指控被起诉，而监管机构也会对起诉的意图进行调查。

There is an opportunity for the blockchain community to reassess, reorganise and act to prevent rather than to cure.

Over the next year, we should look to exchanges to lead the way. In traditional financial services they compete with each other but otherwise, theoretically and practically, they sit neutral to other market participants. This is because the point of an exchange is to sit centrally as a common venue for the bringing together of buyers and sellers. It is an exchange’s job to set standards to help ensure the smooth, orderly running of their marketplace. Exchanges make decisions about who can participate and under what conditions. Confidence in the market is key – it’s what allows participants to conduct business and for industries to grow.

We should expect the same in the blockchain community.

区块链社区有机会重新评估、重组和采取行动，以预防而非治愈。

在接下来的一年里，我们应该寻找交易所来引领这一方向。在传统的金融服务中，它们相互竞争，但在理论上和实际上，它们对其他市场参与者保持中立。这是因为交易所的意义在于集中作为一个共同的场所，让买家和卖家聚集在一起。设立标准是为了帮助确保市场平稳有序运行，这是交易所的职责。交易所决定在什么条件下，谁可以参与。市场的信心是关键，它让参与者敢于开展业务，促进行业的发展。

我们在区块链社区中也应该有同样的期待。
