Years, and even centuries, never really begin on Jan. 1st.

一年，甚至世纪，从来不是真正开始于1月1日。

You can always spot the real beginning in events that occur a bit later, or a bit earlier, than the official start. The 20th century, for example, began in 1914 with the burst of World War I and left the stage to the new millennium in 1989 when communist economies collapsed and opened to free enterprise.

您可以随时查看比正式开始稍晚或稍早的事件的真实开始。例如，20世纪里1914年是第一次世界大战的爆发，1989年开始了新世纪，共产主义经济崩溃，自由企业开放。

For those interested in the practical future of blockchain, and of many other things, the year 2017 began on June 17, 2016. On that day, for the first time in human history, a robot "stole" [more than $45 million](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/) from a group of human beings, following the instructions of an unnamed human being.

对于那些对区块链的未来确实感兴趣的人，以及其他许多事情，2017年其实是从2016年6月17日开始的。那一天，人们历史上第一次，一个机器人从一群人们身上“偷走”了[超过4500万美元](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/)，这是在一个不知名的人们的指令下进行的。

The robot has a name, instead, an infamous name: it was called The DAO. This robot had already broken a record: it was the first robot to get the control of [more than 150 dollar million](https://www.coindesk.com/the-dao-just-raised-50-million-but-what-is-it/), provided voluntarily by human beings by buying DAO tokens. The DAO was not a robot like those we see in the movies, that are often as emotional as human beings. The DAO was a real robot: a smart contract, a distributed piece of software designed to follow its internal code blindly and precisely.

机器人有一个名字，一个臭名昭着的名字：它被称为DAO。这个机器人已经打破了一个记录：它是第一个通过购买DAO代币获得[超过1.5亿美元]	(https://www.coindesk.com/the-dao-just-raised-50-million-but-what-is-it/)控制权的机器人。 DAO不像我们在电影中看到的机器人那样，会和人们一样激动人心。 DAO是一个真正的机器人：一个智能的合约，一个分布式的软件，旨在盲目而精确地遵循其内部代码。

So did he also when instructed to move 45 dollar million to the account of the unnamed man, with instructions that were consistent with the code written for it. This code said also that this money would only become available 28 days later. And until then, the robot was going to protect the money from the unnamed man and from anyone else.

他还被指示将4500万美元转入某无名人士的账户，指示遵循为其编写的代码。该合约也表示，这笔款项将在28天后才能获得。在那之前，这个机器人将会保护那个不知名的人和其他人的钱。

## History happens
## 历史的发生

In the meanwhile human beings, as they often do, split into [two opposite groups](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-hard-fork-creates-competing-currencies-support-ethereum-classic-rises/).

与此同时，人们，就像他们经常做的那样，分裂成[两个相反的群体](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-hard-fork-creates-competing-currencies-support-ethereum-classic-rises/)。

A minority thought that everything was fine, that there had been no theft since everything had been consistent with the code written for the robot. A majority, though, thought that what had happened was an error, a human error, a coding error, and that the unnamed man was a thief.

少数人认为一切都很好，没有盗窃，因为一切都符合为机器人编写的代码。然而，大多数人认为发生了什么事情是一个错误，一个人为错误，一个编码错误，而这个不具名的人是一个小偷。

This could have been the beginning of a war. But we were not in the "real" world. We were on the blockchain, we were on ethereum.

这可能是一场战争的开始。但是我们并不处于“真实”的世界。我们在区块链上，我们在ethereum上。

The humans decided to redouble the distributed robot. One robot led the minority to protect the rights of the unnamed man, the other robot got a slightly new code and led the majority to the recovery of the stolen money. Both things happened… proportionally to the choice that human beings running the robot in a decentralized fashion made with their client software. It was the first big hard fork in the blockchain space.

人们决定再制造一个分布式机器人。一个机器人带领少数人保护不知名人士的权利，另外一个机器人得到了一些新的代码，并带领大多数人恢复了被偷的钱。这两件事情都发生了......与人们用分散的方式运行机器人的选择成比例，这是通过客户端软件完成的。这是区块链领域的第一个大分叉。

In the meanwhile, The DAO had lost credibility, and its tokens were losing their value. Criticisms were made of the programmers, the community, its leaders. According to most observers, this was going to be the end of the concept of smart contracts and of tokens, or maybe even of the concept of public blockchain as a way to raise and store the value needed to carry on a project.

与此同时，DAO失去了信誉，它的代币失去了价值。针对程序员，社区，领导人的批评随之而来。大多数观察家认为，这将是智能合约和代币概念的终结，甚至可能是公共区块链的概念：一种提升和存储项目所需价值的方式的终结。

It was, in fact, the beginning. The explosion of ethereum, the [ICO phenomenon](https://www.coindesk.com/ico-tracker/) and the forks of bitcoin that marked 2017 were the fires started by The DAO spark. Less shallow observers, in fact, in looking at that case, had spotted the beginning of a revolution.

事实上，这只是开始。以太坊的爆发，[ICO现象](https://www.coindesk.com/ico-tracker/)以及2017年标志着比特币的分叉是由DAO火花引发的火灾。实际上，在这种情况下，浅层的观察者发现了一场革命的开始。

For the first time, a blockchain had been able to collect millions on a real project. For the first time, the process had been tested, its weaknesses observed and governance solutions never seen before had been proposed, discussed and implemented.

一个区块链第一次能够在一个真实的项目上收集数百万美元。这个过程首次经过测试，观察到其弱点，并提出，讨论和实施了以前从未见过的治理解决方案。

People understood that the blockchain and the smart contracts were real. Now, ethereum was ready to become a hub allowing hundreds of projects to get funding more easily, more freely… maybe too easily.

人们知道区块链和智能合约是真实的。现在，以太坊已经准备好成为一个中心，允许数百个项目更容易，更自由地获得资金，甚至于也许太容易了。

This is what we observed in 2017, while bitcoin and ethereum ecosystem grew to the next order of magnitude. It was the year when it became obvious what the blockchain really is: a power to do things that were impossible before.

这是我们在2017年观察到的，而比特币和以太坊生态系统则增长到了下一个数量级。今年区块链的真正功能将变得显而易见:一种力量去做前所未有的事情。

The idea that it is a technology for doing in a "faster" or "cheaper" way exactly the same things we have always done is misplaced. It is not necessarily cheap (often it is quite expensive) and when it does things faster, this happens because some fundamental principles have been changed, such as changing what we mean by "accounting," what we mean by "settlement" and what we mean by "privacy."

认为它是一种以“更快”或“更便宜”的方式来完成我们一直做的事情，这是错误的。它不一定便宜（通常是相当昂贵的），当它做得更快的时候，这是因为一些基本原则已经改变了，比如改变我们所说的“审计”的含义，我们所说的“结算”以及我们所说的“隐私”。

## The new network
## 新的网络

This misconception is still holding back the development of the so-called "[private blockchains](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-the-difference-between-open-and-permissioned-blockchains/)" that saw so many experiments and proofs-of-concept in 2017, but nothing yet that was even marginally disruptive.

这种误解仍然阻碍了所谓的“[私人区块链](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-the-difference-between-open-and-permissioned-blockchains/)”的发展，在2017年经历了这么多的实验和概念验证，但迄今为止，还没有什么是具有破坏性的。

Even private blockchains can in principle be a transforming power. The principle of open entry is important for blockchain robustness, yet open entry can also occur within a range of actors that does not include the whole humanity, but only those that accept some rules and satisfy some requirements.

即使是私有的区块链，原则上也可以是一个转变的力量。公开进入的原则对于区块链的稳健性是很重要的，尽管在一系列不包括整个人类的参与者中，也可能会出现公开进入，但只有那些接受一些规则并满足一些要求的参与者才能进入。

What, however, does not exist, is a blockchain that really works without shifting the balance of powers toward decentralization.

然而，不存在的是一个区块链，它在不改变权力平衡的情况下真正发挥作用。

Even a centralized entity can make good use of a blockchain. But this happens only if the central authority wants to change its role from the "validator of everything" to become the "validator of last resort" or to become an "invalidator" that uses a proof of authority only in case of well-defined problems.

即使是一个中心化的实体也可以很好地利用区块链。但是，这种情况只有当中央当局想要将自己的角色从“一切的确认者”变成“最后的确认者”，或者只有在明确的问题的情况下才成为使用权威证明的“无效者”时才有可能发生。

When a business is run on a blockchain, additionally, there is an unavoidable increase in transparency and in determinism. Even without necessarily losing privacy, certainly, players have to expect to lose some accounting opacity. And some elements of vagueness that are typical of paper-based business need to be lost.

另外，在区块链上进行业务时，透明度和决定性也会不可避免地增加。当然，即使没有一定的隐私保护，玩家们也不得不期望降低一些审计的不透明性。而纸质业务中典型的模糊性要素则需要丢失。

And, last but not least, there are human controls that need to be replaced by cryptographic security and distributed automation if we want a blockchain to be of any use. Most private blockchains are vague, or even agnostic, on topics such as the governance and the balance of powers. They do not define who validates transactions, or what is the consensus protocol.

最后但并非最不重要的是，如果我们希望区块链有其用处，那么就需要用加密安全和分布式自动化来取代人为控制。大多数私人区块链都是模糊的，甚至是不可知论的，就像治理和权力平衡这样的话题。他们没有定义谁来验证交易，或者共识协议是什么。

But the purpose of a blockchain is to innovate and define precisely these aspects! Most private blockchains are also vague in defining what kind of value will flow through digitally signed transactions and will be stored on the shared registry.

但区块链的目的是创新和精确定义这些方面！大多数私有区块链在定义通过数字签名的交易时将会流动的价值，并将存储在共享注册表中，也是模糊的。

It may be digital versions of fiat currencies – yet unseen – or the IOUs of an institution, or even no value at all, just information. But a blockchain is a web network of value, if value does not flow one risks having a lame network.

它可能是法定货币的数字版本 - 即使是看不见的 - 或者是一个机构的借条，甚至根本就没有价值，只是信息而已。但是区块链是一个有价值的网络，如果价值不流动，就会有一个网络跛行的风险。

## What you missed
## 你错过了什么

An often overlooked truth in the noise about cryptocurrencies, blockchain and smart contracts is that they mark the entry of robots in the field of transactions and contracts.

关于加密货币，区块链和智能合约的一个常常被忽视的事实是，它们标志着机器人进入交易和合约领域。

This means that, as robots start driving cars, they will also start managing our money, our transactions and our agreements in a decentralized fashion, with the purpose of making them less reliant on centralized control or multiplication of intermediaries. This is happening already in the public blockchain, and this is what the public blockchain has shown, also in 2017.

这意味着，正如机器人开始驾驶汽车，他们也将开始以去中心化的方式管理我们的资金，我们的交易和我们的协议，目的是减少对中间人的集中控制或增加的依赖。这已经发生在公共区块链上，这也是公共区块链所显示的，这也是发生在2017年。

Not everyone, unfortunately, has been able to see what was really going on.

不幸的是，并不是每个人都能看到真正正在发生的事情。

Even the name smart contracts may have been a misnomer, hiding the fact that ethereum smart contracts are more "robot counterparties" than “contracts” in the classic sense. But we may remind that Nick Szabo, in the paper that introduced the concept of smart contracts, described the "humble vending machines" as the "primitive ancestors of smart contracts." (So were the old juke-boxes. The first reassuring prehistoric robots we got accustomed to giving our money to.)

即使名称智能合约可能是一个误导，隐瞒以太坊智能合约更多的是“机器人交易对手”而不是“经典意义上的”合约“。但是我们可以提醒一下，尼克·萨博在介绍智能合约概念的文章中，把“不起眼的自动售货机”形容为“智能合约的原始祖先”。 （旧的自动取款机也是，我们第一次习惯于把自己的钱放在让人放心的史前机器人）。

Of course, many will be frightened of obtaining decentralization, transparency and higher guarantees through giving part of control to that special kind of immaterial robots that are called smart contracts.

当然，很多人会害怕通过对那种被称为智能合约的特殊的非物质机器人进行部分控制来获得分权，透明和更高的保证。

I feel the need to make two remarks here. First, the DAO showed clearly that such a fear is not irrational. Yet, we will probably get over it. (Self-driving cars are still creepy, for reasons that are surely rational.) Yet, they will grow in reliability and will drive us all, and this is likely to start sooner rather than later.

我觉得有必要在这里做两点评论。首先，DAO清楚地表明，这样的恐惧不是不合理的。尽管，我们可能会克服它。 （自驾车仍然令人毛骨悚然，原因肯定是合理的。）但是，它们的可靠性将会提高，并将驱动我们所有人，而且这可能会很快就开始。

Second, there are ways to make smart contracts less frightening. Although decentralized automation is needed for a smart contract to work, smart contracts can be designed to be "state channels" that formalize rights and set constraints in a bilateral flow without the need of robot counterparties.

其次，有办法使智能合约不那么可怕。尽管智能合约的工作需要分散自动化，但智能合约可以被设计成“形式化渠道”，在不需要机器人交易对手的情况下，将权利形式化，并在双向流程中设定约束条件。

This is what we have seen in some proposals for private blockchains.

这是我们在一些关于私人区块链的建议中所看到的。

More importantly, state channels can be the foundation of a mixed private-public approach to smart contracts, where agreements are taken bilaterally and, as long as the two counterparties agree, the exchange of value happens off-chain in a layer-two bilateral communication.

更重要的是，国家渠道可以成为智能合约混合公私合作的基础，双方达成协议，只要双方达成一致，价值交换就会发生在双边的双方沟通中。

Just in case settlement is needed, or a dispute emerges, a representation of the current state of the transaction between the parties is sent to a public blockchain to be settled, potentially following some pre-agreed code whose hash is stored on the blockchain.

在需要和解的情况下，或者出现争议时，双方之间交易的当前状态的表示被发送到公共区块链来解决，可能遵循一些预先商定的代码，其哈希存储在区块链中。

This can also be a solution to the scalability problem that exists in current blockchains, where for each and every transaction all validating nodes have to run the code of the smart contract. This can also be a solution to the privacy issue that still makes many institutions wary of the blockchain. (Another solution to privacy may come from ring signatures or zero-knowledge proofs, and we may see relevant breakthroughs in 2018, probably coming from the efforts of researchers and the public community on the topic.)

这也可以解决当前区块链中存在的可扩展性问题，对于每一个事务，所有验证节点都必须运行智能合约的代码。这也可以成为解决隐私问题的办法，仍然使许多机构对区块链持谨慎态度。 （隐私的另一个解决方案可能来自环形签名或零知识证明，我们可能会在2018年看到相关的突破，可能来自研究人员和公众社区对这一主题的努力。

All this points to the fact that the year to come, 2018, could be the year when (financially oriented) human beings and (smart contract) robots make contact.

所有这一切都表明，即将到来的2018年可能是（财务导向的）人类和（智能合约）机器人进行接触的一年。

And start understanding each other, marking the arrival point of a process started with The DAO failure.

并开始相互理解，标志从DAO失败开始的进程的结束。

And so I have spoken more of 2016 and 2018 rather than of this 2017 that comes to an end. This was maybe to be expected, since the present is, in the end, just an immaterial veil between the past and the future, a haze on the path where the flow of time, technology and innovation is taking us, fuelling our fears for what we have not yet fully come to understand.

所以我已经讲了更多的2016年和2018年，而不是这个2017年即将结束。这可能是可以预料的，因为现在，最终，只是一个过去和未来之间的面纱，随着时间流逝，技术和创新正在给我们的道路上带来阴霾，而我们还没有完全明白什么加剧了我们恐惧。
