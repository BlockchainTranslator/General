Common Pitfalls Every Crypto Trader Will Experience 
加密货币交易指南：每个加密货币交易者都会经历的四个常见陷阱

“I’m Smarter Than Most People – I Won’t Make the Same Mistakes” 
一. “我比大多数人都聪明—我不会犯同样的错误”
Even as I write this, I’m sure that there is a percentage of individuals that will still assume that they are an outlier to this pitfall anyway. 
尽管我这样写，但我确定仍然有很多人认为他们不会掉进这个陷阱中。

This pitfall is something that doesn’t catch everyone, but it absolutely murders those that are smart. Yes, I’m aware that you majored in Finance at an Ivy League University, you were the smartest in all of your classes, and you almost got a perfect score on the SAT. You’re a well-read individual and you pick up on things fast. In fact, you’re so smart that when you come across new games/challenges, it takes you almost no time at all to become an expert! 
这个陷阱不会让每个人都陷入其中，但是它会伤害那些聪明人。我知道你可能曾就读于常青藤盟校的金融专业，你曾是班级中最聪明的学生，你的大学入学考试成绩接近完美，你知识渊博并且学习能力极强。事实上，你是如此聪明，当你遇到新的挑战，你很快就可以成为专家。

Trading isn’t like that and none of those things qualities that I listed above, matter 
但是，加密货币交易并非如此，上述所列出的品质都无关紧要。 
Trading is a psychological game. A high schooler can learn how to chart, read indicators and gauge market cycles – it’s not rocket science. It’s about whether one is willing to put in the time and dedication to learning those concepts and trying them out. 
交易是一个心理游戏。高中生就能学会看图表，读行情以及估算市场周期——这并不复杂。这要看你是否愿意投入时间和精力来学习这些概念并付诸实践。

The difficulty with accepting most market strategies is that many of them are counter-intuitive to how we’re wired as human beings. Most people scream “buy the dip!”, but you see few traders actually employ that strategy because, as humans, we’re wired to avoid a stock/cryptocurrency that’s been in the negative a lot recently. 
真正的困难在于许多市场策略都是反直觉的。大多数人都喊着要“逢低买入”， 但是实际上很少有人这样做，因为人们都倾向于避免在近期这样的股市或者加密货币大跌时买入。

This is just one of the many ways that smart people beat themselves on the market. Smart folk also tend to be more resistant toward adopting tried and true market strategies. Usually, smart individuals have thrived throughout their life by abandoning the beaten path and figuring out something of their own that works. And for the most part, this has worked. However, it won’t in trading. 
这是在加密货币市场中聪明人打败自己的原因之一。聪明人一般不喜欢采用屡试不爽的市场策略。他们通常摒弃常规，寻找一些行之有效的方法来获得成功。对于大多数情况，这种方法很奏效。

Unfortunately, trading isn’t something that you’re going to be able to “force” in your favor the way that you’ve probably done with a lot of other things in your life. You’re going to have to sit down and study market theory, charts, and indicators just like everyone else. If not, you’ll continue to pay the price and trust me when I say that the market isn’t merciless. Understanding crypto market fundamentals is a key foundation in the crypto world. 
然而，在加密货币交易中，情况并非如此。市场交易不会按照你的喜好而发展，你应该像其他人一样静下心来学习市场理论、研究图表、观察行情。如果你不这样做的话，你将会继续付出代价。市场并不残酷，了解加密货币市场基本原理是在加密货币世界生存的基础。

Joining a Pump & Dump Group 
二、加入“拉高出货”组织
No one likes to admit this, but chances are that 95%+ of cryptocurrency traders have joined a PnD group at some point in time, either wittingly or unwittingly. 
尽管没有人愿意承认这一点，但是很可能有95%以上的加密货币交易者在某个时刻有意或者无意地加入了“拉高出货”组织。

Perhaps it was the allure of the potential gains that you could make. You rationalized it in your head – and from an objective perspective, it makes sense. The coins that they target are relatively low market cap, so it’s definitely more than possible for them to bump the price up several percentage points. So, you figure if you just join one of these groups, you can follow the “calls” and get easy money from them. Simple, right? 
这可能是因为你受到了潜在收益的诱惑。你在脑海中把这件事情合理化，从客观角度来看，这说得通。他们所看重的货币市值相对较低，所以对于他们来说把价格拉高几个百分点是更有可能实现的。因此，你认为如果加入这些群体，你就能够跟着“指引”并且很容易赚到钱。这很简单，对吧！

Unfortunately, this is often never the case. Here’s how PnD groups typically work: 
但是，情况并非如此。下面是“拉高出货” 群体的操作方式：

They’re composed of a bunch of “whales” (stakeholders with a LOT of free capital – $1 million or more typically). 
他们由很多大户组成（持有100万美金或者更多的自由资本）

These whales decide which coin that they’d like to “pump” – (Dogecoin used to is a favourite of theirs). 
这些大户决定拉高哪种加密货币（狗狗币曾是他们最喜欢的币种）

All of the whales get their positions in the cryptocurrency before they eventually pump the coin. Sometimes they take weeks doing so. 
在最终拉高价格之前，所有的大户都会做好准备。有时他们会花费几周时间来准备。

The most common technique that they employ is the use of multiple buy/sell walls in order to force individuals to sell into their orders or buy the sell orders that they have up in order to keep the price stable as they accumulate more coins for the ‘pump’. 
为了让人们卖出订单或者买入出售订单，这些大户最常用的技巧是多次买卖。这些出售订单是大户在大量吸入筹码以拉高价格时为了让价格保持稳定而分批卖出的。

Once they’ve accumulated enough coins to be satisfied, they slowly move the price upward and then squeeze out ‘weak hands’ (people who are finicky when it comes to “hodling” cryptocurrency who sell at the slightest chance of profit loss), and continue to gradually increase the price. 
一旦他们吸入了足够的筹码，他们就会慢慢抬高价格，在挤掉一些散户后，继续提升价格。

Usually, by the time they’re announcing the pump to the general public (the Telegram/Discord/Slack group that you more than likely joined), they’ve already gained 100%+, if not more than that. 
通常，在他们通知组员拉高价格的时候，他们已经获得了100%以上的收益。

Whales are smart, so they figured out that it would be a dumb strategy if they simply dumped all of their coins at once because they would destroy the price of small market cap coins and end up with worthless bags of the coin they were trying to pump, which would undermine the entire purpose of the pump itself. 
大户们都很聪明，如果他们立刻低价抛售所有货币，那将会是一个非常愚蠢的策略，因为他们会破坏这些币的市值，最终手里的币会一文不值，这也会破坏拉高出货的目的。

Therefore, they created the pump groups in order to generate ‘buyers’. As individuals eagerly purchase the cryptocurrency thinking that they’re on the ‘inside’ of a real pump, the only thing that they’re doing is just buying up the sell orders of the whales that have already made their money. 
因此，他们组建了拉高出货群。当人们渴望购买加密货币时，他们认为自己处于真实的价格升高中，他们唯一在做的事情就是购买那些已经挣到钱的大户们的出售单。

Once the whales have successfully sold you all of their bags, they exit the market and continue about their day. Meanwhile, you’re stuck waiting and hoping that the ‘pump’ will eventually happen and it never comes. In fact, more than likely you’re going to be ‘dumped’ on as the others that bought the cryptocurrency realize that they’ve been suckered and start to sell everything they have. 
一旦这些大户们成功卖出所有的加密货币，他们就会退出市场，继续生活。与此同时，你陷入了等待并希望价格会真正上升，但是这永远也不会发生。事实上，当其他购买加密货币的人意识到他们已经被骗并且开始卖出所有货币的时候，你极有可能会经历“大跌”。

Losing Money; Lots Of It 
三、损失资金
Everyone loses money trading, that’s just a part of the game. Even the experts lose money. If they claim that they don’t, then they’re simply lying to you. It’s hard if not downright impossible to get every call right. There’s just some shit that’s not going to go your way and there’s nothing you’ll really be able to do about it. In those cases, you have to be able to accept your losses and move on. 
每个人在交易中都会有损失，这只是游戏的一部分。即使是专家也会遭受损失，如果他们说没有遭受过损失的话，那么就是在对你说谎。你做的决定不可能都是正确的，总会有一些不如意并且无计可施的情况。在那种情况下，你只能接受损失并且向前看。

There are plenty of stories about legendary traders that had great success on the markets at one point in time, only to lose it all later. Hopefully, you don’t become one of those guys that “lose it all” because you’ll be practising good investment techniques. However, it’s always a possibility if you don’t remain disciplined in this highly volatile and risky world. 
有很多关于传奇交易者的故事，这些交易者在市场的某一时刻非常成功，之后却一无所有。希望你不会成为他们中的一员，因为你会不断练习投资技能。然而，如果你在充满波动和风险的世界中没有保持自律的话，还是可能遭受损失。

When you do lose money (and it could be a hefty sum), you just have to remember to keep your wits about you and remind yourself that it happens to everyone. It doesn’t make you an idiot, you don’t need to sell your house now (hopefully), and it doesn’t mean that you have to quit trading or that you’re a horrible trader. It happens to the best of us, trust me. There are well-respected traders out there that have made tens of millions on the market that get killed at times. It’s all a part of the game. 
当你遭受损失的时候，你只需要保持理智并且提醒自己每个人都可能会有此遭遇。这不会让你看上去很傻，你现在也不必卖掉房子，这不意味着你要停止交易或者你是一个糟糕的交易者。相信我，最好的交易者也会遇到这种情况。有很多在市场中赚得盆满钵满的交易者也曾多次损失惨重。这都是游戏的一部分而已。

Making Emotional Trades 
四、冲动交易
There will more than likely be a time in your trading career that you make a really great trade or a really terrible one. In either case, you’ll be at your most vulnerable. Why? Because your emotions will be at a peak. When you make a really great trade, you feel like a genius. The euphoric feeling of making a shitload of money out of the blue coupled with the fact that it manifested from your own strategy breeds a dangerous level of confidence and exuberance that will have you making some really stupid choices if left unchecked. If you’re wondering how so many great traders have gotten killed on the markets before, then this may be the number one reason. 
在你的交易经历中，你很可能完成过特别棒的交易或者特别糟糕的交易，无论是哪一种情况，在那一刻你都是最脆弱的。为什么？ 因为你的情绪会在那一刻极其高涨。当你完成了一笔非常棒的交易，你会觉得自己是个天才。突然之间赚了一大笔钱同时还证明了你的交易策略，这会滋生盲目的自信，如果你没有察觉的话，这将促使你做出非常愚蠢的选择。如果你想知道如此多的优秀交易者是怎样被市场绞杀的，这可能是最主要的原因。

The hubris that usually accompanies successful trades is what leads many traders to make riskier investments than they otherwise would have under the pretence that they hold a superior knowledge to all others in the marketplace. Keep in mind that this will almost always lead to your downfall at some point. 
比起那些假装自己比其他人更了解市场的投资者来说，那些因成功而变得傲慢的投资者会做出更具风险的决定。记住这几乎会让你在某一刻破产。

The markets will humble you if you don’t respect them 
如果你不尊重市场，你将会被它打败。

Of course, there’s the other side of the coin too. You just made a terrible trade and you’re down 25% or more on your portfolio. You watched with horror as you tabulated your final portfolio value and see a loss of several thousand dollars. The shame and anger begin to set in. How could this happen to you? 
当然，加密货币市场也有另一面，你刚刚做了一笔非常糟糕的交易，让你损失了25%或者更多。你惊恐地看着你的投资组合估值表上损失了几千美金，这种羞耻和愤怒向你袭来，心想怎么会发生这样的事情呢？

As humans, we hate these emotions and when we feel them, our first instinct is to stop feeling them, to put it crudely. So, what do traders usually do? Make another trade. This psychological tendency is no different than a gambler at Vegas that just got murdered at the blackjack table. Instead of walking away with a loss, his/her psychology tells them that they should play another hand and double up their bets in order to cover the losses. The mentality of, “I’m just one trade away from erasing that horrible decision that I made in the past” begins to take over, which is quickly followed by desperation. 
作为人类，我们讨厌这些负面情绪，当我们感受到这些情绪时，我们的第一反应是停止这些感受并且把它们搁置一旁。那么，交易者们通常会怎么做呢？他们会再做一笔交易，这种心理倾向和在拉斯维加斯赌桌上损失惨重的赌徒的想法没有任何区别。与其带着损失离开，他们的内心说应该在玩一把，把筹码加倍以弥补损失。这种“我要再做一笔交易来抹去之前所做的糟糕决定”的心态开始占据你的大脑，随之而来的便是沮丧。

I’ve witnessed that more often than not, this is the most frequent way that traders lose money. 
我经常看到这种情况，交易者通常因此损失惨重。
