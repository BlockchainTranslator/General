Distributed ledger technology, or DLT, is the advancement that underpins an array of new financial products, including cryptocurrencies and digital payment services. Many have identified DLT as the next great driver of economic efficiency. Some have even compared it to productivity-driving innovations such as the steam engine and personal computer.

去中心化账本技术（DLT）是支撑一系列新金融产品（包括加密货币和数字支付服务）的先进技术。许多人认为DLT是经济效率的下一个重要推动力。有些人甚至把它比作生产力驱动的创新，如蒸汽机和个人电脑。

Our task, as market regulators, is to set and enforce rules that foster innovation while promoting market integrity and confidence. In recent months we have seen a wide range of market participants, including retail investors, seeking to invest in DLT initiatives, including through cryptocurrencies and so-called ICOs, initial coin offerings. Experience tells us that while some market participants may make fortunes, the risks to all investors are high. Caution is merited.

作为市场监管者，我们的任务是制定并执行促进创新的规则，同时促进市场的完整性和信心。近几个月来，我们看到包括零售投资者在内的广泛的市场参与者试图投资于DLT举措，包括通过加密货币和所谓的ICO，最初的硬币产品。经验告诉我们，虽然一些市场参与者可能发财，但是所有投资者的风险都很高。谨慎是值得的。

For perspective, look to the 1990s. Countless companies chased the dot-com promise, yet only a fraction survived. Fewer still provided their investors with life-changing returns.

佐证这一观点，看看20世纪90年代。无数公司追逐网络公司的承诺，但只有一小部分幸存下来。为投资者提供改变生活的回报仍然较少。

This is not a statement against investments in innovation. The willingness to pursue the commercialization of innovation is one of America’s great strengths. Together Americans embrace new technology and contribute resources to developing it. Through great human effort and competition, strong companies emerge. Some of the dot-com survivors are the among the world’s leading companies today. This longstanding, uniquely American characteristic is the envy of the world. Our regulatory efforts should embrace it.

这并不是反对投资创新的声明。追求创新商业化的意愿是美国的强项之一。美国人共同拥抱新技术，并为开发新技术贡献资源。通过伟大的人力和竞争，强大的公司才能出现。一些.com公司的幸存者是当今世界领先的公司之一。长期以来，世界一直羡慕着这唯一的美国特色。所以我们的监管工作应该接受它。

History also has proved that transparency, investor protection and market integrity are critical to ensuring that innovation continues. But today we are seeing substantial DLT-related market activity that shows little or no regard to our proven regulatory approach. This concerns us.

历史也证明，公开度，投资者保护和市场诚信对于确保创新持续至关重要。但是今天我们看到了与DLT相关的大量市场活动，而这些活动很少或根本没有考虑到（无视）我们经过验证的监管方式。这使我们感到担忧。

Earlier this month, the collective market capitalization of cryptocurrencies [topped](http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-global-cryptocurrency-market-capitalisation-january-3-2018-1) $700 billion. Direct participation by U.S. investors in cryptocurrencies is significant. The prices for these currencies are set by trading on “spot” platforms. Many of these platforms are based offshore—and none are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.

本月早些时候，加密货币的集体市值[高达](http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-global-cryptocurrency-market-capitalisation-january-3-2018-1)7000亿美元。这直接是由美国投资者直接参与加密货币所影响的。这些货币的价格是通过“现货”平台进行交易。这些平台中有许多是基于境外的，而且都没有在商品期货交易委员会或证券交易委员会注册。

Advocates and investors initially promoted cryptocurrencies as a payment-facilitation alternative to traditional currencies such as the dollar and the euro. But cryptocurrencies lack a fundamental characteristic of traditional currencies, namely sovereign backing. They also lack other hallmarks of traditional currencies, such as governance standards, accountability and oversight, and regular and reliable reporting of trading and related financial data. Significantly, cryptocurrencies are now being promoted, pursued and traded as investment assets, with their purported utility as an efficient medium of exchange being a distant secondary characteristic.

倡导者和投资者的初衷是将加密货币推广为传统货币（如美元和欧元）的支付便利。但是加密货币缺乏传统货币的基本特征，即主权支持。他们也缺乏传统货币的其他标志，如治理标准，问责和监督，以及定期和可靠的交易和相关财务数据报告。值得注意的是，加密货币现在作为投资资产被提升，追加和交易，因为其声称的效用是作为一种未来的的次要特征的有效的交换媒介。

A key issue before market regulators is whether our historical approach to the regulation of currency transactions is appropriate for the cryptocurrency markets. Check-cashing and money-transmission services that operate in the U.S. are primarily regulated by states. Many of the internet-based cryptocurrency-trading platforms have registered as payment services and are not subject to direct oversight by the SEC or the CFTC. We would support policy efforts to revisit these frameworks and ensure they are effective and efficient for the digital era.

市场监管机构面临的一个关键问题是，我们以往的货币交易监管方法是否适合加密货币市场。在美国运营的支票兑现和货币传输服务主要由国家管理。许多基于互联网的加密货币交易平台已经注册为支付服务，并且不受SEC或CFTC直接监管。我们重新审视这些框架，努力提出支持政策来确保它们在数字时代是有效和高效的。

In some areas, federal authority to police cryptocurrencies is clear. The Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations establish federal anti-money-laundering obligations that apply to most people engaged in the business of accepting and transmitting, selling or storing cryptocurrencies. In other areas, some say, federal authority is murkier. Some proponents of cryptocurrencies note that the jurisdiction of the CFTC and SEC over cryptocurrency transactions is limited and cite the absence of U.S. and other government market regulation as an investment attribute. Such claims should give prospective investors pause.


在一些地区，联邦政府对加密货币的管理政策是明确的。 “银行保密法”及其确立的实施条例确立适用于大多数从事接受和传输，销售或存储加密货币业务的人员的联邦反洗钱义务。有些人认为，在其他领域，联邦当局更为混乱。一些加密货币的支持者指出，美国商品期货交易委员会和美国证券交易委员会对加密货币交易的管辖权是有限的，并且指出美国和其他政府市场监管缺乏投资属性。这种说法可能让潜在投资者停下入场脚步。

Recently, two of the largest CFTC-regulated exchanges listed bitcoin futures products. Although the exchanges are permitted to “self-certify” and commence trading futures products without CFTC approval, for bitcoin futures they spent significant time engaging with CFTC staff and agreed to implement risk-mitigation and oversight measures, including heightened margin requirements and a requirement that the exchanges have information-sharing agreements in place with underlying bitcoin trading platforms. As a result, the CFTC gained oversight over the U.S. bitcoin futures market and access to data that can facilitate the detection and pursuit of bad actors in underlying spot markets.

最近，两家最大的CFTC监管的交易所上市了比特币期货产品。尽管交易所被允许“自我认证”，并且在未经CFTC批准的情况下开始交易期货产品，但对于比特币期货，他们花费了大量的时间与CFTC员工进行交涉，并同意实施风险缓解和监督措施，包括提高保证金要求，而且交易所与底层比特币交易平台之间已经建立了信息共享协议。因此，美国商品期货交易委员会对美国比特币期货市场进行监督，并能够获取有助于发现和追踪底层现货市场中不良参与者的数据。

The SEC does not have direct oversight of transactions in currencies or commodities. Yet some products that are labeled cryptocurrencies have characteristics that make them securities. The offer, sale and trading of such products must be carried out in compliance with securities law. The SEC will vigorously pursue those who seek to evade the registration, disclosure and antifraud requirements of our securities laws. In addition, the SEC is monitoring the cryptocurrency-related activities of the market participants it regulates, including broker-dealers, investment advisers and trading platforms.


SEC不直接监督货币或商品交易。然而，一些标签使得加密货币的产品具有成为有价证券的特征。此类产品的报价，销售和交易必须遵守证券法。证券交易委员会将大力监督那些试图规避我们证券法的注册，披露和反欺诈要求的人。此外，证券交易委员会正在监督其监管的市场参与者的加密货币相关活动，包括经纪商，投资顾问和交易平台。

The SEC is devoting a significant portion of its resources to the ICO market. Through statements, reports and enforcement actions the SEC has made it clear that federal securities laws apply regardless of whether the offered security—a purposefully broad and flexible term—is labeled a “coin” or “utility token” rather than a stock, bond or investment contract. Market participants, including lawyers, trading venues and financial services firms, should be aware that we are disturbed by many examples of form being elevated over substance, with form-based arguments depriving investors of mandatory protections.

证交会正在把大部分资源投入到ICO市场。证券交易委员会通过声明，报告和执法行动已经明确表示，无论所提供的证券 - 一个有目的宽泛和灵活的期限 - 被标记为“硬币”还是“实用标记”，抑或是股票，债券或投资合同，联邦证券法都将适用。包括律师，交易场所和金融服务公司在内的市场参与者应该意识到，我们受到很多形式上的实质性抬高的形式上的干扰，以形式为由剥夺了对投资者的强制性保护。

The CFTC and SEC, along with other federal and state regulators and criminal authorities, will continue to work together to bring transparency and integrity to these markets and, importantly, to deter and prosecute fraud and abuse. These markets are new, evolving and international. As such they require us to be nimble and forward-looking; coordinated with our state, federal and international colleagues; and engaged with important stakeholders, including Congress.

美国商品期货交易委员会和证券交易委员会以及其他联邦和州监管机构和刑事当局将继续共同努力，为这些市场带来透明度和诚信，重要的是阻止和起诉欺诈和滥用。这些市场是崭新的，不断发展的和国际的。因此，他们要求我们灵活而具有前瞻性;与我们的州，联邦和国际同事进行协调;并保证包括国会在内的重要利益。

Distributed ledger technology may in fact be the next great disruptive and productivity-enhancing economic development. If history is any guide, DLT is likely to be followed by many more life-changing innovations. But we will not allow it or any other advancement to disrupt our commitment to fair and sound markets.

去中心化账本技术实际上可能是下一个具有巨大破坏性但又能提高生产力的经济发展点。如果历史有其指导作用，那么DLT很可能造成更多的改变生活的创新。但是，我们不会允许它或任何其他的进步破坏我们对公平和健全的市场的承诺。
