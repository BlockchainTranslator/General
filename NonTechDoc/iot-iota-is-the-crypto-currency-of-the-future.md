Even today, machines manage to do their job without human intervention. If, in addition, an autonomous payment transaction between machines needs to take place, one requires a digital currency. But for good reasons that will likely not be Bitcoin or Ethereum, but more recent developments like IOTA.

即使在今天, 机器也能在没有人为干预的情况下完成工作。此外, 如果需要在机器之间进行自动付款交易, 则需要数字货币。但有很好的理由, 可能不会是比特币或以太坊, 而是最近的发展出的IOTA。


### The Internet of Things (IoT)
### 物联网

Kevin Ashton, who has created and co-founded an international standard for RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and other sensors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is viewed as the inventor of the Internet of Things (IoT).

Kevin Ashton在麻省理工学院 (MIT) 创立并共同创立了一个国际 RFID (射频识别) 和其他传感器的标准, 被认为是物联网(IoT）的发明者。

The objective is to give all things that are currently dependent on the control of their human owners, a kind of own life using the Internet.

它的目标是给所有目前还依赖于主人控制东西, 在互联网上有自己的生活方式。

Such applications already exist today, but we are only just at the beginning. Networked thermostats are already learning when to stay where in our home and adjusting the temperature to save on heating costs.

这种应用已经存在, 但我们只是刚刚开始。网络恒温器已经在学习何时留在我们的家和调节温度, 以节省供暖费用。

IoT is currently particularly interesting for logistics, as more and more packages and containers have to be sent to our global market. The basic idea is simple: Packages are identified by a chip, which not only stores product information but also their transport destination. Like data streams on the Internet, broadcasts find their way to the destination itself.

由于越来越多的包装和集装箱必须送到我们的全球市场, 物联网目前的发展尤为有趣。基本思想很简单: 软件包是由芯片标识的, 它不仅存储产品信息, 而且还保存其传输目的地。就像互联网上的数据流一样, 广播也找到了到达目的地的路。

If a consignment arrives at a sorting machine, informs it of the destination, it will be sorted accordingly and forwarded to its destination. These processes run quickly and autonomously without a central authority. The package thus finds its own way.

如果托运物到达分拣机, 它会通知它的目的地, 然后被相应地排序, 并转发到其目的地。这些进程在没有中央授权的情况下快速而自主地运行。因此, 该包找到了自己的方式。

Such decentralized self-intelligence allows for local failures to have an impact only on the entities themselves and not affect the processes as a whole.

这种去中心化的自我智能使得本地故障只对实体本身产生影响, 而不影响整个过程。

RFID is the basic technology for networked goods and their environment. This technology uses radio transmission to read and write data from tags without contact and thus manages information related to the goods themselves.

RFID 是网络产品及其环境的基本技术。该技术使用无线电传输从标签中读取和写入数据, 而无需联系, 从而管理与货物本身相关的信息。

RFID tags and the things they are attached to become standalone objects that find their way through the Internet of Things and control the systems within which they move.

RFID 标签和其他使它们成为独立对象的部件, 通过物联网和控制系统来找到移动路线。

If we think of self-driving cars, they must also be able to communicate within the Internet of Things. If a deer runs in front of the car, the car must recognize the deer in milliseconds and apply the brakes. Sensors and brakes must be able to communicate with each other without human intervention. Artificial intelligence is a necessity on top of that.

如果我们想到自动驾驶汽车, 他们也必须能够在物联网上沟通。如果一只鹿在汽车前面奔跑, 汽车必须在几毫秒内认出这只鹿并应用刹车。传感器和制动器必须能够在没有人工干预的情况下相互通信。人工智能是最需要的。

### Why Bitcoin does play a role in the Internet of Things

### 为什么比特币会在物联网上扮演一个角色

Bitcoin consists of a database, the blockchain, a kind of journal, in which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. The Bitcoin payment system uses a peer-to-peer network to which all participating computers connect.

比特币包含一个区块链数据库, 类似一种期刊, 上面记录了所有的比特币交易。比特币支付系统使用点对点网络, 所有参与的计算机连接。

This Bitcoin network records all Bitcoin transactions. The blockchain is redundantly and decentrally stored on all Bitcoin nodes, managed and constantly updated over the Bitcoin network, eliminating the need for banks.

比特币网络记录了所有比特币交易。区块链是冗余的，去中心化存储在所有比特币节点, 管理和不断更新的比特币网络,取消了对银行的需求。

So could Bitcoin take over all of our current payments using the blockchain? There are interesting facts that justify a clear no, at least for now. In the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, annual energy consumption has already reached the level of consumption of a medium-sized country like Cuba. And that with very few transactions!

那么, 比特币可以接管目前区块链上的所有支付吗？有一些有趣的事实证明了明确不行, 至少现在是这样。在比特币区块链上, 每年的能源消耗已经达到了像古巴这样的中型国家的消费水平，而且只有很少的交易!

To illustrate this: for a single digital currency transaction, 215 kilowatt-hours of electricity are needed; i.e., the annual energy consumption of a fridge! Overall, about 0.08% of the world’s current energy consumption is attributed to Bitcoin activities, and the trend is rising.

来说明这一点: 对于一笔数字货币交易, 需要 215 千瓦时的电力;也就是, 一台电冰箱的年能耗!总体而言, 比特币能源消耗大约占世界能源消耗的0.08%, 而且趋势正在上升。

Therefore, it is a fact that globally produced energy would not be enough to cover all previous payment transactions with Bitcoin.

因此, 事实是全球生产的能源将不足以涵盖比特币所有以前的付款交易。

So what to do now? Global digital networking could soon make it possible to connect all machines in an industrial production chain. Such so-called machine-to-machine relationships (also called M2M) will play an important role in the near future in order to optimize processes decisively.

那现在怎么办？全球数字网络很快就能将所有机器连接到一个工业生产链中。这种 称之为机器对机器关系 ( M2M) 将在不久的将来发挥重要作用, 以果断地优化过程。

IOTA offers fast and secure processing of the transactions, without Blockchain as would be customary with Bitcoin. IOTA is based on a new distributed ledger, Tangle, which overcomes the inefficiencies of the current blockchain design and introduces a new way of consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system.

IOTA提供快速和安全的交易处理,区别于比特币类的区块链。IOTA是基于一个新的分布式分类帐, Tangle, 克服了当前区块链计的效率低下, 并在去中心化的点对点系统中引入了一种新的共识方法。

If you take a look at blockchain today, it is a single chronological thread that connects one block with another. This has limitations such as the 10-minute interval at Bitcoin. What IOTA is doing now is that it uses many chains instead of one chain.

如果你看看现在的区块链, 它是一个单一的时间线, 连接一个又一个。这是有限制的, 例如比特币的10分钟间隔出一个区块。IOTA现在做的是, 它使用许多链而不是一个链。

This allows people to use IOTA, for example, to transfer money without any fees. And especially micro-transfers such as parking fees, car wash, bread rolls or your regular tabloid can be executed free of charge and fast.

这使得人们可以用IOTA, 例如, 转移资金而不需要任何交易费。特别是诸如停车费、洗车、面包卷或普通小报等小额支付, 可以免费和快速地执行。

As the Tangle grows, and more participants perform transactions, the overall system becomes even safer and faster, and verification times continue to decrease.

随着Tangle的增加, 会有更多的参与者进行交易, 整个系统变得更加安全和快速, 验证时间也在不断减少。


At IOTA, there are no miners like Bitcoin that require a transaction fee to validate a transaction and include it in the next blog. Instead, the consensus is completely decentralized, with each network participant executing a transaction, and the previous transactions are directly and indirectly confirmed.

IOTA不像比特币中的矿工需要交易费来验证交易并将其包含在下一个区块中。相反, 共识是完全去中心化的, 每个网络参与者都在执行一笔交易, 而以前的交易是直接和间接确认的。

For IoT, where machines pay machines, we need a payment system that can process tiny transactions in huge numbers and in real time. It must be cheap, or even better, free, fast and scalable. And that is exactly what Bitcoin cannot do, according to experts, but it remains to be seen what improvements the newly created Lightning network will bring.

在很多情况下, 机器支付机器, 我们需要一个支付系统, 可以处理实时的小额交易,。它必须便宜, 甚至更好, 免费, 快速和可伸缩。据专家们说, 这正是比特币所不能做到的, 但还有待观察新创建的闪电网络将带来哪些改进。

Here, payments are to be executed via many separate micropayment channels, which make it possible to execute transactions virtually in parallel to the Blockchain. Instead, two users can make as many transactions as they like, without informing all the participants in the blockchain about the cash flow. Only the final amount of their transaction will be noted afterwards.

在这里, 付款将通过许多单独的支付渠道执行, 这使得可以执行几乎平行于区块链的交易。相反, 两个用户可以进行尽可能多的交易, 而不通知 区块链中的所有参与者有关现金流的信息。之后, 只有最后的交易金额才会被记录。

### Summary
### 总结

IOTA is scalable and payments are free, making many applications in the IoT viable. Not without reason are companies like Bosch very interested in such technologies, because a future in which each car pays for itself in the parking garage makes our lives easier.

IOTA是可伸缩的, 支付是免费的, 使许多应用在很多可行的。像博世这样的公司对这种技术非常感兴趣是不无理由的, 因为每辆汽车在停车场为自己支付的未来使我们的生活更轻松。

Whether IOTA can prevail, only the future will show, because a “proof of concept” must be provided in real world applications. As with Bitcoin, the risk of the bubble is significant, because without genuine applications I personally consider such a crypto-currency worthless.

IOTA是否能占上风, 只有未来才知道, 因为一个 "概念证明" 必须在现实世界有应用。与比特币一样, 泡沫的风险是巨大的，如果没有真正的应用, 我个人认为这样的数字货币一文不值。

What is exciting, however, is whether the Lightning network will have a positive effect and whether profitable applications may soon be on display.

然而, 令人兴奋的是, 闪电网络是否会产生积极的影响, 是否有能获益的应用可能很快就会知晓。

Nevertheless, IOTA currently seems to be much better equipped than the energy waster Bitcoin, which is why it is at least part of my watchlist.

然而, 目前看来, 比起能源浪费比特币, IOTA似乎要好得多, 这就是为什么它至少是我名单的一部分。
