BERKELEY, Calif. — While the price of Bitcoin has dropped since Christmas, the virtual currency boom has shown no signs of cooling off in the more august precincts of America’s elite universities.Several top schools have added or are rushing to add classes about Bitcoin and the record-keeping technology that it introduced, known as the blockchain.Graduate-level classes this semester at Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Duke, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland, among other places, illustrate the fascination with the technology across several academic fields, and the assumption that it will outlast the current speculative price bubble.

尽管比特币的价格已经下跌，但虚拟货币的繁荣让美国的精英大学在这个领域的投入热情丝毫没有减弱。几所顶尖的学校紧急增加了有关比特币和区块链的技术课程。本学期在卡内基梅隆大学，康奈尔大学，杜克大学，麻省理工学院和马里兰大学等的研究生课程中，区块链技术在多个学术领域中的吸引力暴涨。

“There was some gentle ribbing from my colleagues when I began giving talks on Bitcoin,” said David Yermack, a business and law professor at New York University who offered one of the first for-credit courses on the topic back in 2014. “But within a few months, I was being invited to Basel to talk with central bankers, and the joking from my colleagues stopped after that.”For a class this semester, Mr. Yermack originally booked a lecture hall that could fit 180 students, but he had to move the course to the largest lecture hall at N.Y.U. when enrollment kept going up. He now has 225 people signed up for the class.

2014年，纽约大学的商业和法律教授David Yermack开设关于该主题的首批学分课程之一，他说：“当时，我开始聊比特币的时候，受到一些同事的反感。”但是几个月后，我被邀请到巴塞尔，和中央银行家们会谈后，我的同事再也没有笑过我。这学期的一堂课，Yermack先生最初预定一个可容纳180名学生的演讲厅，随着注册人数的暴涨，他现在必须将课程移至纽约大学最大的讲堂，现在已经有225人报名参加了这个课程。

A course about virtual currencies created by a Princeton computer science professor, Arvind Narayanan, has been the fifth-most-popular class on Coursera, an online learning site.And last month at the University of California, Berkeley, students were lining the walls and sitting in the aisles for the first lecture of “Blockchain, Cryptoeconomics and the Future of Technology, Business and Law.”“This is a very precious opportunity for you to be able to sit in this class,” Dawn Song, a computer science professor, told the students. “There are a bazillion other students who are waiting for your spot.”

由普林斯顿计算机科学教授Arvind Narayanan创建的有关虚拟货币的课程一直是在线学习网站Coursera上第五受欢迎的课程。上个月在加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校上课的时候，学生们为了听一门“区块链，密码经济学 - 技术，商业和法律的未来”的讲座，有的人站在墙边，有些甚至是坐在走道上听课的。“如果你能够参加这个课程，这是非常宝贵的机会，”计算机科学教授Dawn Song告诉学生。 “有很多其他学生正在等待你的位置。”

Because developments in the field are moving so fast, the business school professor also teaching the class, Greg La Blanc, said the students would have to forgive the teachers if they got things wrong on occasion.“We aren’t waiting until we perfect it,” he said. “Don’t compare it to the perfect blockchain course. Compare it to having no blockchain course at all.”

由于该领域的发展是如此迅速，商学院教授们也在上类似的课程，Greg教授说，即使偶尔发现老师上课说错了，学生们也不得不原谅老师。“这些课等不到我们把它们做的非常完美，”他说。 “不要把它比作完美的区块链课程，这总比没有区块链课程来的好。

The 75 spots in the Berkeley class were divided evenly among the law school, the business school and the engineering department, and faculty from the three departments are teaching the course together. Ms. Song said she had around 100 students vying for the 25 places set aside for her department.

伯克利大学的区块链课程的75个上课席位在法学院，商学院和工程学院中平分，三个部门的教师一起教授这门课程。Song女士说，她有大约100名学生争夺为她的部门预留的25个位置。

The interest is a fueled by the rising price of virtual currencies over the last year. But they have created a host of issues that are worthy of study even apart from the price, professors in a variety of fields said.For lawyers, virtual currency projects have challenged traditional legal categories and definitions of what constitutes a security or a commodity.For economists and business school professors, Bitcoin and other digital tokens have raised questions about the nature of money. The first lecture in the Berkeley class, for example, considered the development of Bitcoin against the history of money。Several business school classes are also focusing on the decentralized methods of record keeping and decision making introduced by Bitcoin.“The students in my class are from every possible discipline,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke’s business school, who is teaching a class with 231 students this semester. “They understand that this is going to disrupt many different areas of business, and they want to be the disrupters, not the disruptees.”

去年随时虚拟货币价格上涨推动大众对区块链的兴趣高涨。但是，除了价格之外，各个领域的教授都表示，它们创造了一系列值得研究的问题。对于经济学家和商学院教授来说，比特币和其他数字代币已经引发了关于货币性质的问题。例如，伯克利课程的第一个讲座就是考虑比特币与货币历史的发展。几个商学院课程也关注比特币引入的分布式记录和决策方法。“我班上的学生来自各个领域，”杜克商学院Harvey教授说，他本学期正在为231名学生授课。 “他们明白，这个技术将颠覆许多不同的业务领域，他们想成为颠覆者，而不是被打扰者。”

The computer scientists, meanwhile, are digging into the cryptography that virtual currencies use to secure their wallets and transaction data, as well as the design of the distributed computer networks that make blockchains possible.Last week, Stanford University hosted a three-day conferenceon the architecture and security of blockchain software, part of a new cottage industry in academic conferences and journals that have sprung up.

与此同时，计算机科学家正在深入研究虚拟货币用来保护它们的钱包和交易数据的密码学，以及设计能让区块链落地的分布式计算机网络。上周，斯坦福大学举办了为期三天的区块链软件架构和安全会议，这是一个在学术会议和期刊上涌现出来的新兴行业。

“Let’s assume that tomorrow the price of Bitcoin drops down to $2,” said Nicolas Christin, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, who is teaching a course on “Cryptocurrencies, Blockchains and Applications” this semester. “I still think it’s very cool from a technical standpoint.”

“假设明天比特币的价格跌落到2美元，”卡内基梅隆大学的计算机科学Nicolas教授说，他正在这个学期教授“加密货币，区块链和应用程序”课程。 “从技术的角度来，我仍然认为看它非常酷。”

Professors and students alike said that aside from the academic possibilities, familiarity with blockchain technology was becoming much more useful on the job market.The job site Indeed.com has reported a spike in job listings that mention the blockchain, and there is now an entire site, Crypto Jobs List, dedicated to opportunities in the young industry.

教授和学生们表示，除了学术以外，熟悉区块链技术会在就业市场上变得更有优势。就业网站Indeed.com报道称，在招聘信息中已经涉及到了区块链，并且现在有一个完整的网站Crypto Jobs List，专门为这个年轻的行业提供机会。

Vinny Tuminelli, a business school student sitting at the back of the Berkeley class, said that during an internship at Anheuser-Busch last summer, the blockchain had come up in an “innovation team” he was on. When he met with his supervisor more recently, the topic came up again。“My original understanding was that it was just thrown out there as a buzzword,” Mr. Tuminelli said. “But now it seems like it has some legs behind it, and people are putting real resources toward it.”

商学院的学生Vinny坐在伯克利班的后面，他说，去年夏天在Anheuser-Busch的实习期间，区块链出现在他所在的“创新团队”中。当他最近与主管会面时，这个话题再次出现。“我最初的理解是，它只是一个流行词，”Vinny说。 “但现在看起来它背后有真正价值的支撑，人们在这其中投入了资源。”

Students appear to have caught on to the opportunity faster than their professors. Berkeley students have created a campus club that offers multiple courses on blockchain technology, taught by the students themselves The director of M.I.T.’s Digital Currency Initiative, Neha Narula, said that when it didn’t schedule a course for this semester, she got constant requests from students. So she put one together and is now co-teaching it. 
“Students are just fascinated with this area,” she said. “They want to learn about it desperately.”

学生们似乎比他们的教授更迅速地抓住机会。伯克利的学生创建了一个校园俱乐部，提供区块链技术的多门课程，由学生自己教授。M.I.T.数字货币计划主任Neha Narula说，区块链本来没有安排在本学期的课程中，但她不断收到学生的请求。所以她把学生们放在一起，现在共同教学。“学生们对这个领域非常着迷，”她说道， “他们非常渴望想要了解它。”
